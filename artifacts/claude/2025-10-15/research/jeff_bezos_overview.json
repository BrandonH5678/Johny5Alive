  "key_facts": [
    "Amazon founded 1994, grew to e-commerce and cloud computing dominance",

    "Snowden paradox: WaPo published leaks while owner pursued CIA contract"
  ],
  "power_structure": "Bezos controls Amazon (AWS IC contracts) and Washington Post (national security coverage), creates structural conflict where newspaper owned by CIA contractor, editorial independence maintained in theory but financial incentives favor IC, WaPo Snowden coverage occurred during CIA contract negotiation period",
  "strategic_significance": "Bezos ownership of WaPo while holding massive IC contracts represents modern Operation Mockingbird - no need to recruit journalists when owner has financial incentive to maintain IC relationships, structural conflict creates pressure for favorable coverage, demonstrates intelligence community influence through market power rather than infiltration",
