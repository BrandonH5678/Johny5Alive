    "Government mandates: Federal, state, employer vaccine requirements drove sales",
    "Clinical trial controversies: Adverse event reporting, trial unblinding, data transparency issues",
    "FDA revolving door: Scott Gottlieb (former FDA Commissioner) joined Pfizer board 2019",
    "Suppression of alternatives: Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, early treatments discouraged to maintain EUA",
    "Booster push: Repeated boosters despite waning efficacy, CDC/FDA aligned with Pfizer objectives",
    "Regulatory capture: FDA funding partially from pharmaceutical industry user fees"

  "concealment_mechanisms": [
    "Clinical trial data: Pfizer sought 75-year delay on FOIA release of trial documents",
    "Adverse events: VAERS system limitations, underreporting, passive surveillance",
    "Liability shield: PREP Act prevents legal discovery of safety issues",
    "Regulatory capture: FDA funded by pharma, approval process lacks independence",
    "Media influence: $3+ billion advertising spend creates financial incentive for favorable coverage",
    "Alternative suppression: Early treatments discouraged to maintain vaccine EUA",
    "Mandate coercion: Government requirements obscured voluntary consent issues",
    "Data opacity: Full clinical trial results not transparent, selective disclosure"

  "power_structure": "Pfizer developed mRNA vaccine with government contracts, FDA expedited approval via revolving door relationships, CDC recommended universal vaccination aligned with commercial interests, federal/state mandates enforced uptake, liability shields prevented legal accountability, media advertising spend suppressed critical coverage",
  "strategic_significance": "COVID-19 response demonstrated pharmaceutical-government fusion - unprecedented liability shields, mandates, regulatory capture, and profit concentration, Pfizer revenue dependent on government policy coordination, censorship of alternatives and adverse events, represents broader pharmaceutical industry control over health policy",
