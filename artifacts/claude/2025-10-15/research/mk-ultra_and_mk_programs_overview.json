    "overview": "MK-Ultra was an illegal CIA human experimentation program (1953-1973) designed to develop mind control procedures and interrogation drugs. Part of a larger cluster of behavioral control programs including Bluebird, Artichoke, MK-Naomi, and MK-Search.",

  "key_findings": [
    "MK-Ultra approved April 13, 1953 by CIA Director Allen Dulles in response to alleged Soviet/Chinese/North Korean mind control use on POWs",
    "Sidney Gottlieb arranged CIA purchase of entire world LSD supply for $240,000",
    "150+ human experiments involved psychedelic drugs, paralytics, electroshock therapy",
    "Experiments conducted on unwitting and cognizant subjects",
    "Program included psychiatric research to 'crush the human psyche to the point that it would admit anything'",
    "Most records destroyed by Richard Helms and Sidney Gottlieb in 1973",
    "Frank Olson death November 28, 1953 after being dosed with LSD by Gottlieb - ruled suicide but evidence suggests murder",
    "Program exposed publicly in 1975 by Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission",
    "Survived 20,000 pages discovered 1977 at non-standard records center",
    "Program originated from Operation Paperclip Nazi scientist recruitment"
  ],

  "research_methodology_notes": "This analysis employs peripheral evidence attack strategy: when direct records are destroyed, reconstruct from financial records, institutional partnerships, victim documentation, and surviving fragments. Congressional appropriations, university IRB records, pharmaceutical shipment logs, and victim lawsuits provide angles of approach that cannot be destroyed by the primary perpetrators."
