1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
For us, military, act of military individuals were so stoked to see J. Stratton's name come

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
out.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,160
And I said, why?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,320
And they're like, because this is the one individual who is credible military intelligence,

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,920
who's where DIA, who's working tons of programs in ONI, all these different intelligence agencies

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,160
that has pushed not only to be honest and true to the American public, but to create

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,240
an interface so that we could honestly bring forward to the American public what we know

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,680
and don't know about the UFO or what he helped systematized UAP process.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,680
And the reason he said he did that was to destigmatize reporting of UFOs.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,880
So this guy is trying to destigmatize reporting of UFOs, trying to systematize it.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,200
So that reporting becomes better as a learning process as bumpy as it is.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,040
People would put reports in from let's say the nimmits or any of these encounters.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
They wouldn't hear back.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,320
They thought it got lost in the ether.

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,240
They didn't want to get mental checks.

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,760
But he made it cool to report and learned along the way.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
I respect that.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,680
So a lot of military people are like, that is so amazing to get him to talk because he's

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,880
talking for us.

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
We don't have voices.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
He's got a voice for us.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,080
So I just want to tell you that's what I've gotten a lot of.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
So that's who we're talking about.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,680
Talking about a very serious, credible individual who's worked in intelligence capacity,

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,000
who's done the right thing and he's done the right thing in a way to help destigmatize

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,080
and communicate with the American public.

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,600
So we don't have the same problems as Project Bluebook, the cover what's in his own words.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,640
What Roswell did to the situation, the lies from our government.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,640
I think it's, so now I know we might be interviewing this guy and that's really cool.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,080
Well, I learned that he was going to be there, that he and his colleague Travis Taylor

31
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,880
were going to be at this event, this SCU conference.

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
They're going to be in the audience.

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
It was sort of the coming out party in a sense.

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,160
Both had been hired to work by Radiance Technologies and the releases when they were

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,680
each of them was hired.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,160
Jay was hired first and then he convinced Radiance that, hey, Travis Taylor is a really qualified

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
guy.

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,680
He's the guy I'd like to work with here and they hired him as well.

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,200
And the releases for both of those guys were astonishing in that unlike most defense contractors,

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,720
they don't want to talk about UFOs.

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
I don't want to mention it.

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,000
They don't want to give it any credence, even some of them who probably have a deeper

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,440
roots with the topic than they cared to admit, they don't highlight it.

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,040
This Radiance Technology, those releases both bragged about, in essence, they highlighted

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,880
the fact that both these guys had worked on UFO programs for the US government.

46
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,280
It was as if they were saying, this is no longer a forbidden topic.

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,480
We want to be involved in it at every level.

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,240
In fact, if you got some UFO contracts to give out to private industry, we're ready

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
to go.

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,200
I think I can get away with saying this.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,440
I think it's fine, but so we filmed that Radiance, that's okay.

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,440
You did a news report, how cool to be shown what we were able to be shown.

53
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,920
We couldn't film what they're doing there.

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,000
To some degree, I mean, obviously they have offices at Wright Patterson for their technology

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
company.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,200
But with what they could show us, we had to get the special badges which we couldn't even

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
photograph.

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
All that stuff.

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,480
Do you remember when I was pushing him, I was like, that's a skiff.

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Let me see inside the skiff.

61
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
I don't believe it.

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Let me see inside the skiff.

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,480
I don't do that to everybody.

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
He's not going to show you.

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,040
And then they're finally like, okay, you can peek inside the door, but they don't say

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
a word.

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,520
There's something going on in there.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
But it's okay.

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
It's okay.

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
I think I can, yeah.

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,040
I didn't believe him opened that door.

72
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Holy cow.

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,240
I mean, there was some cool stuff going on.

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,720
Bam, close the door.

75
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,400
It was nice to them to let me peek and just to verify, you know what?

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
It's a cool company.

77
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,680
It's a lot of ways.

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,400
It's owned by the employees.

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
The employees own.

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Everybody benefits from if they, when they do well.

81
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,760
They have offices in 17 states, nearly all of them are attached to or within US Air Force

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
bases.

83
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
So they're at Wright Patterson.

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,720
They're at Nellus, two bases that we know have a long history of involvement with the

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,320
subject that is near and dear to our heart.

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,200
And so they do serious work.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,920
You can see hints of it on their website.

88
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
The kind of things they do.

89
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,360
But essentially, that company does reverse engineering work, which in the UFO world, that

90
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,400
term is laden with, with hidden meaning, you know, it suggests taking things apart to

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,120
figure out how they work, things that we did not build.

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
But they do that.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,560
And Jay Stratton, who went to work for him, specialized in reverse engineering.

94
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,840
And not just technology, not just systems, machinery, but in situations.

95
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,360
When he worked for the DIA, he would reverse engineer potential threats, figure out who might

96
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,320
be flying what their capabilities were and what kind of systems we might need to

97
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
counter that.

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,560
I mean, he was, he was a top expert in that kind of work.

99
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,960
And we'll allow him to maybe explain some of the jobs that he held at the Pentagon.

100
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Definitely.

101
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,760
And additionally, you know, I also want to be clear, we weren't shown anything we weren't

102
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
supposed to see.

103
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,800
But it was just neat that we got that tour and be able to see in certain rooms.

104
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,560
Obviously, they keep a real kind of locking key.

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,560
But I just got to say it was such a cool experience for a company like that to be so open

106
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,240
for the first time with journalists coming in there and even the President sat down and did

107
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,400
an interview and you did a report on it.

108
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,600
It really shows that they're interest in the reverse engineering and things.

109
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm sure they would love to have some of the goodies.

110
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
And they would be great company.

111
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Well, yeah.

112
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I said it.

113
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
All right.

114
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
You hired Jay Stratton.

115
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,800
You hired Dr. Travis Taylor.

116
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,680
It sounds like maybe you guys are taking a part of flying saucer or building one and they kind

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
of joked about it.

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,520
Well, yeah, we kind of like to do that if we got a chance to.

119
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,320
You know, it's so compartmentalized with a company like that, the President even told

121
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,440
us, it's like, he has tons of projects going on that he is not read into because that's,

122
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,640
you know, that's how it's stovepipe.

123
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,120
So with this company out there and you and I going out there and getting people were

124
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,520
approaching us that were told to approach us.

125
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
And that was really interesting to me because I was having so much at that thing that there

126
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,680
were people in the audience, the people still don't know who they are.

127
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,920
And they trusted us with numerous things which will be coming public at some point.

128
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Yeah.

129
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,720
Well, we went there with some goals and minds as if they goals and talking to Jay Stratton

130
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,480
and to Travis Taylor would have been if that was all we got that would be awesome.

131
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,360
We didn't know for sure if that was going to happen, but that's what we went there to

132
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
do.

133
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,600
And then we ended up meeting a bunch of other people who introduced themselves and began

134
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,440
a dialogue with us that I think we were bare fruit throughout this whole year.

135
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,000
And I was like, okay, you know, we're going to film this.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,360
I got my buddy all the way from, you know, he flew in from Mexico and here we go.

137
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,920
And then I was like, oh, no, man, we're not recording in a hotel room.

138
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,680
I was like, oops, not about that.

139
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,000
You know, visually, but we had to do it kind of private.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,880
We needed to make sure that it was the information was well documented.

141
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,480
Another thing that, so when we started the interview, something that Jay said kind of

142
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:28,720
right away, that was so interesting to me was that all sap from that very onset was

143
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
technological.

144
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,040
It was technology.

145
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,960
It was about discovery of disruptive technologies.

146
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,000
And you look at all the durs and the reports, and obviously they're thinking forward

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,720
looking 30, 50 years from now.

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,600
What could be a disruptive technology?

149
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,400
No matter where it's from, what could be a disruptive technology.

150
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,160
And then he said, but look, where the evidence led is that there were other things that

151
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
we learned.

152
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,880
There was a disruptive technology aim, but that there were a lot of other things they

153
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,400
learned when they were studying things like the ranch.

154
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,200
So that really threw me for a loop that, you know, something like, OASAP came in with

155
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,400
the idea of identifying future threats.

156
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,480
And then realized, wow, there's a lot more going on.

157
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
He talked about that in his interview with us.

158
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,760
So we spoke his off.

159
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
That's just this one.

160
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Yeah.

161
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Yeah.

162
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Eyes off.

163
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
And of large or off.

164
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I came with our own statement.

165
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
A.B.

166
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Comment marker.

167
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Okay.

168
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Jay, you've done it on camera interview before.

169
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Have you done interviews before?

170
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
So it's the first.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,040
I mean, your world is the black world.

172
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Last night's time.

173
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Right?

174
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,800
Can you give me broad strokes of your career, the highlights, and I kind of secure a program

175
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
to your work now?

176
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Sure.

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,960
You know, I started military.

178
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,280
I was a full-time reservist with the Air Force, and then I moved up to Maryland to work

179
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:03,480
at Pax River to do weapons integration with the F-18 flight test out of Navier.

180
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,960
And from there, I went to the Office of Naval Intelligence, where I was recruited to be an air

181
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,720
space engineer, working with them, to look at, you know, really apply the blue knowledge

182
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,880
as we call it, and apply it to the red, and potential adversaries, and right up, reports

183
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,080
on what I think foreign capabilities can do or not do, in a sense, reverse engineering.

184
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Absolutely.

185
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:32,480
And take that into DIA, went over to the Defense Intelligence Agency, to work in the Defense

186
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Warning Office, where I was applying the same knowledge, but at a higher level, and more

187
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,680
kind of orchestrating the intel community at that point.

188
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,440
And there's a term we use validation, whereas if you're building an F-22, or you're building

189
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,080
a joint strike fighter, you know, you're really kind of designing that to counter a potential

190
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,720
threat, and that potential threat needs to be a validated threat, because what we can't

191
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,960
have happen is a Lockheed Martin or Boeing, you know.
