1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
You know, constantly telling, we would never have a source on.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,600
But the thing is, is like, what does it mean to be a source?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,000
Sometimes, you and I have received stuff

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,080
that we don't know exactly who or where came from.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,920
So our job for years sometimes,

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,520
which is what's now a lot of that's coming out.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,360
But like, for years, it's to figure out the validity

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,960
of information rather than the source of information.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,400
That's interesting, isn't that?

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
That's something unexpected to me.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,000
You know, the people who are real heroes in this saga,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,040
this ongoing saga, Dr. James LaCatsky,

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,280
who's single, almost single, handedly,

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,040
with the help of Harry Reid and Robert Bigel

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,200
had got the ASAP program created.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,600
And then Lu Elazando, who rescued the remnants of it

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,080
and got a tip and kept it going.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,440
And then Jay, Stratton, who was part of all of this,

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,680
all those programs and beyond into the current era,

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,360
he might be the most important UFO government UFO

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,480
investigator ever of all of them.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,240
And it's so great to be able to talk to him.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,720
We have so much more that we haven't been able to share yet,

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,640
but we will, over the next course of the year,

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,400
and hopefully he'll be here to live sometime.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,360
Yeah, and look, this program,

27
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,720
however, this audio and visual program,

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,120
it's because we know we can now.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,720
Now we're gonna have people here.

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,480
It's every time we're able to use this

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,160
to get stuff out that you and I wouldn't normally be able

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,760
to get out in any traditional means.

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
So I am excited.

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,640
It would be great right here if there was somebody

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,360
who worked in one of the government UFO programs

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
that could sit right here next to us.

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,440
Wouldn't that be great?

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,520
Well, look at the wheels that are turning

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,120
because of the work of the guys I just mentioned.

40
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,280
Like Hatsky, Colom Calahir, Lu Elazando, Jay Stratton,

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,480
the work that they did,

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,280
toiling an obscurity for so many years,

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,560
is really paying dividends.

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,320
I mean, this is not a terrific report,

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
but the fact that it exists at all is amazing.

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,680
The fact that they have now have a streamlined process

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,960
and have taken away some of the stigma attached

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,920
to reporting UFOs is amazing progress

49
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,640
in a short period of time.

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,800
And Congress maintaining an ongoing interest in this.

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,160
They're demanding more information.

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,120
We don't know what's in the classified version of this,

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
but it's exciting.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
It's awesome, and the legislation

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,720
that offers protection to whistleblowers

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,960
is also very exciting,

57
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,880
that we're gonna be exploring over the next nine, 10 months.

58
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,320
Is this George Nap being optimistic about that?

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Let me take that back.

60
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,520
Let me take it back.

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,360
Then you can't think of that.

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
I heard it loud and clear,

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,040
it sounded like George Nap is being optimistic about.

64
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,120
You have our transparency in some way.

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,760
Look, man, we're only gonna get as far as we push it.

66
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,800
Nobody wants to give up information.

67
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,920
You know, if it's special to them,

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,400
there's no reason to, but I think if the public demands it,

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,760
we ask nicely and shake the doors a little bit.

70
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,200
Look, there are great people within our,

71
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,720
the majority of our armed services, our intelligence agencies.

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,200
You know, they are just like us.

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,720
They're curious about this, they're excited about it.

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,560
If it's not a matter of national security,

75
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,760
this is stuff that should be told to the American public.

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,520
So I am very optimistic by nature,

77
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,320
but it was kind of cool to hear some optimism from you.

78
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,920
You're not so optimistic sometimes when it comes to traveling

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,760
because of your curse.

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
And I wanna finish this trip and remind you what happened.

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,360
So we are, we do these great interviews

82
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,800
and we're just stoked, man, it was really fun.

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,760
We met really interesting folks that we ended up

84
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,000
having friendships with along the way

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
who I'm sure you will hear from in the future

86
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,640
who are involved in this topic, deeply.

87
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,720
So we're like, okay, let's just get home.

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,880
And of course, we're on some horrible airline.

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,760
There's this photo I put up on social media.

90
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,200
We look like Gorilla's man, we're, we have our bags

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
and we're just walking down this runway

92
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,920
just trying to get on this plane.

93
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,560
We're all messed up because guess what?

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,680
Turns out Miles, if COVID didn't kill you,

95
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,200
I was gonna kill you.

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
My buddy who we were with all week

97
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,040
had really bad COVID.

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm like bleeding coughs and I was like, oh man,

99
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,520
you and I, we escaped it.

100
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
We thought we escaped.

101
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,880
There we are in the plane.

102
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,000
And then we get this lightning storm.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
I have never seen so much lightning in my life out of window.

104
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,800
It was like, it just felt like doom

105
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,680
because of your travel curse.

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,840
But we got back and we still had to sit on this story

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
for, we had to sit on the story up until now

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
and a lot of times.

109
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,600
So it was, it's funny, as a journalist,

110
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
you've probably dealt with this tons,

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,840
but you gotta really respect that someone gives you their trust

112
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,280
and they're allowing you to do this.

113
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,640
So you gotta time everything right.

114
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,240
You can't just throw something up on YouTube

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,120
or throw something out on Twitter.

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
You have to do it responsibly.

117
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,480
Check everything before you do it.

118
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,920
And God forbid you make a mistake,

119
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,320
but if you do, you say it, right?

120
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,080
So that was kind of a neat trip.

121
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,080
We get back and man, we were tired, but we got what we needed.

122
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,520
Yeah, we got so much material from Dr. Taylor

123
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,280
and from Jerry Stratton and the folks at Radiance

124
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,520
and then the people, other people,

125
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,400
we met at the SCU conference.

126
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
And we were really excited to go ahead and share it

127
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,480
with the public, but it takes time, you know?

128
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,960
We didn't have the OK to go ahead

129
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,440
and spill all those beans.

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,280
We do now.

131
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,800
We have permission from Jay to use some parts of that interview

132
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
and I think we're probably gonna be using more

133
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,040
in the future and hopefully we'll be hearing from him live,

134
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,440
maybe on the stage and maybe on other stages.

135
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,560

144
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,440
OK, so what's the big picture now?

145
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,640
Like as we do these and we try to put these pieces together

146
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,400
for public consumption.

147
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,320
And here we are in 2023, you know, what's the big picture man?

148
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,720
Where are we going with this from reports to error

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360
to other agencies we know that are interested

150
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,760
in the UFO subject, like where are we going with this man?

151
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,600
Well, we know that because of that legislation,

152
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,920
there are whistleblowers who are lined up,

153
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,520
at least a few of them that we know of,

154
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,360
who are lined up prepared to tell what they know.

155
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,160
The most interesting, unanswered question is where are the goodies?

156
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,640
Is there met a materials stashed in a warehouse?

157
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,000
Are there intact craft as Bob Lazarus suggested somewhere

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,480
out in the desert?

159
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,520
Are there bodies?

160
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,080
You know, there are people who have told us

161
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,920
that they know that those things are true,

162
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,280
that there are materials, exotic materials from somewhere else.

163
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,600
The question is, are they going to be allowed to speak?

164
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,880
Now, I did express a little bit of optimism

165
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,480
a couple of minutes ago, but I think for them,

166
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,760
it's still a dicey deal, you know?

167
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,280
Stepping forward to tell these incredibly sensitive secrets

168
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,560
comes with the risk.

169
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,160
And we know that there are at least some of them

170
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,640
who are already facing potential consequences

171
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,680
for agreeing to step forward.

172
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,200
Hopefully the stories will come out.

173
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
The information will be conveyed to Congress,

174
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,560
whether or not that information gets to us,

175
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
the public, that's another matter,

176
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
but we'll be doing our best to get it out.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,200
The process designed through the whisperer protection stuff,

178
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,400
the idea of using something like the Inspector General

179
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,960
to move forward with complaints of reprisal

180
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,400
and this sort of thing, I think it is fair to say

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,840
because we've said before, that process,

182
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,320
whether or not it has been formalized,

183
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,920
there are people in this subject

184
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,240
who are using the right mechanisms

185
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,600
to get the information where it needs to go

186
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,440
at a fear of reprisal.

187
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,960
That is something current, that is happening.

188
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,520
So I'm encouraged that that process is there

189
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,960
to protect people, ultimate goal, let's just say it like it is.

190
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,200
There are UFO study programs in multiple agencies

191
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,520
across every branch of our military,

192
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,280
many of which we know about the idea is,

193
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,000
can they go through a formal process

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,280
to bring those illegal programs to where they should go?

195
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,760
This shouldn't be a job of journalism,

196
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
this should be a job of cleaning house,

197
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,920
this should be something that they do on the inside.

198
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,800
Journals do what they do, this should be clear and straightforward.

199
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,320
If there are unknown illegal programs dealing

200
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,160
with non-terrestrial technologies, yes,

201
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,240
that's a huge issue for humanity,

202
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,680
but this also needs to be fixed on the inside.

203
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,800
Absolutely, and this report, for example,

204
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,760
there's a line in there that I found pretty interesting.

205
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,640
It says that we have no evidence of any direct human health

206
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,920
consequences of exposure to UFOs.

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,000
I can hope that sometime in the next 12 months

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
that the arrow folks will go down the hall

209
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
and knock on the door at the DIA

210
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,840
and ask to see the OSAP files, because OSAP, as we have reported,

211
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,720
has very definitive evidence about harmful consequences

212
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
from people who got too close to UFOs.

213
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,000
And there are some very dramatic and well-documented cases

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,720
that the DIA program followed for a number of years.

215
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,200
So having seen some of these reports,

216
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,440
the thing you're saying is that arrow,

217
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,800
who's studying the UFO phenomenon,

218
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,320
they should already have all this documentation

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
of a huge program like OSAP that clearly shows

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,680
that there have been health issues that have been caused

221
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,680
directly from close proximity to UAP.

222
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
And they don't seem to have any knowledge of that.

223
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,280
It was similar to the two guys who appeared

224
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,880
before they're congressional hearing.

225
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,160
The first congressional hearing of 54 years

226
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,160
when they were asked about nuclear incidents, incidents

227
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,000
or a nuclear missile.
