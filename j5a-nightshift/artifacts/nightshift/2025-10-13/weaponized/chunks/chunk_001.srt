1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
typically brought in and tasked because he had certain skill sets that would be good for this

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,400
job. And we know who brought him in and it's so interesting man. I want to get to something

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,280
we had this crazy trip. You want to start talking about that? Yeah. All right. For anybody that

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,400
doesn't know mine and George's friendship and working together once in a while, I get some

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,640
call from George and it's like pack your bags. We got to go get films. We're doing an interview.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,720
And you know just immediately I know oh gosh, so this is the thing now. So my perspective,

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:44,560
I've actually never told you this. My perspective was, okay, George has hopefully a really important

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,080
interview to hear from somebody that could shed light to the American public who's never gone

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,000
on camera. And this is kind of the background. You kind of gave me, you know, this could happen.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,440
But there's also an event going on before we get to that. I'm just like, okay, let me adjust my life

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,200
to like leave in a few days. I needed a second camera. I don't even know how to do

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,280
aperture right, you know, professional filmmaker. I don't even know how to do this stuff right.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,360
I knew this is important. I was like, I need somebody. I called up my buddy Niles Harrison.

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,240
He's laying on the beach in Mexico, right, where he just bought a house. And I'm like,

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,480
I need you on a plane right now. Just, I need to get you to Vegas. And he's like, well, I got all my

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,640
stuff and we have to put it in storage. This dude, Niles Harrison dude, you're my idol man. He packed

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,920
everything up. And in two days, he landed in Vegas to meet us to be the DP or the backup for us. The

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,800
only guy could trust, you know? And I still don't know what the mission is. So I can't tell him

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
the mission, you know? So it's just like this fun kind of experience where I'm like, we get

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,440
to Vegas, I'm like, what's going on, you know, and we hop right on a flight. So just so you know,

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,000
I mean, it was, it was crazy man. This is how it works with you. And me is sometimes I call you

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,400
something as you call me. And it's time to go. Well, the premise for this, there were, there were

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,960
multiple reasons to make this trip. Huntsville, Alabama is a defense hub. A lot of interesting

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,280
defense contractors have grown up around there. Of course, it's Rocket City. It's where the,

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,640
it's where the birthplace of the U.S. base program really was, Warner Bond,

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,080
Brown and his team were all down there. I didn't even know where we were going. Yeah, you know,

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
you're now you're saying it, but like you said, you tell me, okay, let we're going to

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,840
Huntsville, my Huntsware and you're like Huntsville, I'm like, why? Well, in a sense, you know,

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,280
I hate to admit this, but Huntsville has become sort of the de facto UFO research capital of

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,160
America for a long time. For the past 30 years, it's been Las Vegas because of Robert

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Bigelow, his needs organization that became bass that was headquarters for the Ossap program,

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,840
which that's a lot of acronyms, but that program was the largest UFO investigation ever funded

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,520
by the U.S. government that we know of. And so, because of Bigelow and Colin Keller her and their

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,160
colleagues in Las Vegas, Las Vegas was a hub for this research. I think Huntsville might now have

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,440
that title because of all the people who are concentrated there, the defense contractors that have

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,960
grown up around the U.S. rocket program, the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal is there. In addition to

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,440
the defense contractors and the rocket programs and a lot of government agencies,

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,120
there is also a UFO organization, SCU, the scientific coalition for UAP studies.

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,520
Headed by a guy named Rich Hoffman, he's put together a team of scientists. They've done some great

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:41,840
analyses on key cases. The Puerto Rico UFO that was looked like a transmedium for one thing

41
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,560
and they did a tech tech paper. They're doing some great work, but they have an annual conference.

42
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,240
I've been invited to go to each one of them and finally I wanted to go because

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,880
they only had a really great lineup of speakers, but I had a feeling that the audience might be

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,880
more interesting than the people who are up there on the dance given the speeches.

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,520
Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void?

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,160
But with LinkedIn ads, you can know you're reaching the right decision makers and network of

47
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,640
130 million of them, in fact. You can even target buyers by job title industry company,

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,840
seniority skills, and did I say job title? See how you can avoid the void and reach the

52
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,600
Okay, so to back up, so there is, you know, these UFO study groups, but this is one that really

53
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
focuses on the science and technology and it gets great speakers and members and we know

54
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,960
people just come into quietly silently listen that they might be interesting people because it's

55
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,680
in rocket city, but you had an idea that we were going to get a specific interview, but at this

56
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,520
point you're telling me, we're going to this conference, it's a UFO conference, I come on

57
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,320
George and you're like, no, no, it's a cool one. It's like science and I'm like, all right, I texted

58
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,880
it, uh, Ryan Graves, you know, the fighter pilot that everybody knows now and I just wanted to get

59
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,880
a beer with him because we had talked so much and so that was, I was like, okay, I'm coming with

60
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,680
me, we're Ryan, we're going to have a beer and that didn't end up happening. We ended up missing

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,400
each other two ships in the night, but we met a number of really interesting people and we're

62
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,680
able to get some first-ever interviews with people that we're going to come forward and also

63
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,680
recorded with and talked with individuals who people don't know yet, but are also critical and

64
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,320
essential to the UFO puzzle and what's going on with in government and Congress and different

65
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,840
intelligence agencies looking at this, I mean, just straight up, it was fascinating. We had fun,

66
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,680
and we're driving at a car, you think I'm going to kill us, you know, we're making jokes about green

67
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:31,440
pyramids. Our primary concern is getting their life, which is not a given, and the light of the fact

68
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,400
that Jeremy is the person driving. Yeah, the navigator. And the navigator, yeah.

69
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:47,040
Hopefully we arrive in one piece. Oh, fuck, there was a little work in guy with a goddamn pyramid.

70
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,160
It always had a pyramid or triangle, but that's just a drone. That's construction work. So that's

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,840
not a pyramid that you see right there. Well, it's a guy building a pyramid. Oh, yeah,

72
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,160
for the guy building, so is it like the government building a pyramid? Would that be accurate to say?

73
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,600
You could go in for that. I'm staying. I'm going to. And also record. I fucking drive.

74
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,480
Then we had a we had a lot of fun, but what happens next, George? I mean, this is a really neat moment for us.

75
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,840
So I had hoped that we'd be able to land this really important interview with someone who has never

76
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,680
spoken on camera before has never interacted with the media in a way where he could be quoted.

77
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,320
Someone I have known for a long time. You protected his name. I could never mention his name.

78
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,800
I, you know, I've known about him. And then I got to know him. I happen to know that he loves

79
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,760
Linda Mishua Khan, this Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, and has been known to hang out there.

80
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,160
He's he's worked with the nids guys with Bigelow and Callahar and some of those folks.

81
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,160
We'll go into more detail on that in a moment. But there he is. We now know that he had relocated

82
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,080
to Huntsville. One of my favorite stories of last year that we produced for KLA S and Mystery

83
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,440
Wire was about this company. This defense contractor in Huntsville, Alabama that put out an amazing

84
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,680
seemingly innocuous release about two men they had hired. Actually there were two releases.

85
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,200
The one was an announcement that they had hired a guy named Jay Stratton who had been a

86
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,480
lifelong intelligence officer who had worked at the Pentagon in very high level positions for a

87
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,480
number of years. And I was astonished to see his name released in the public because it's been

88
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,120
forbidden that I could ever mention it. So that's the guy. That's the guy. Jay Stratton.

89
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,480
The world doesn't really know Jay Stratton. I mean, some people figured it out. There's been

90
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,320
little things now that have come out. But at that time you had kind of held back. So but the

91
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,480
quite the big question is who's Jay Stratton? Jay Stratton. So if anyone who's read the book

92
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,080
Skinwalkers at the Pentagon written with Dr. James LeCatsky and Colin Keller, there are references

93
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,400
to this guy in there. I don't want to use the name Jay Stratton. He used a different name, but

94
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,520
references to a high level guy, a really credible intelligence officer who was involved in a

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:21,120
key positions in these UFO programs. Ossap, A-tip, the UAP task force and arrow. He is the only

96
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,200
person who has involved in all of those who is sort of the common link from the start of Ossap

97
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,760
through the creation of arrow and continues, I think, to advise the folks who are involved with that.

98
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,880
There's only one guy that's been there for that whole trip who has worked with Ossap and then

99
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,360
Luel as under with A-tip and created, in essence, the UAP task force who got the government

100
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,000
to ship from using the term UFO to UAP who's work. We'll talk about some examples of it.

101
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,600
Back up, you just said, Jay Stratton, did you just say Jay Stratton created the UAP task

102
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,000
force? Yeah. Okay, so that would explain to me why Numerous-
