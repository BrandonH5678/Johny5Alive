1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
And I'm sure we'll talk about the task force,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,800
but I had a five-year plan of how we're going to get

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,840
all of these things that we needed.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,480
But if you're just a working group,

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,160
and trying to do your job and my hat,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,840
and maybe at the headquarters,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,200
I had a certain amount of wiggle room

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,520
for trying to get things done in authorities, right?

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,520
But you needed something above all that.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,640
You needed something at that sick death level,

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,240
at that ODE and I level,

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,640
that could reach into everything

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,560
and had the authority to get the answers that needed.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,360
And Lu and I knew we needed that.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,080
And every time we would try to knock on a door

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,840
and say, hey, we need that, here's what we know, right?

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,240
Here's what we've seen.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,720
A little bit of history on the offs app

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,800
and other things.

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,480
Yeah, you get the door kind of shutting your face

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,240
because it's back to that careerism.

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,360
I don't know.

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,880
This is not, I don't know.

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,720
I'm afraid of the Washington Post.

25
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,160
Was there any involvement of her these stories

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,280
from people we know about fundamentalist religious people,

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,960
high-ups who were concerned about its demons

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,320
or were messing with forces of biblical proportions?

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
There's absolutely some concern there.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,640
And I did see it in writing one time in my career

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,240
where someone was asking me to push back

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,600
because they're religious concerns.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
And you should wave off of this topic

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
because literally what they're telling me,

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,320
shouldn't be involved in this.

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
I know it exists.

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,320
I think what my professional opinion is

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,200
after again years and now of being involved

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
is that seems to have died off.

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
I think one, now I'm elevated into that senior level

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,680
and a lot of my colleagues that were all at the same level

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
that had grown up with me throughout the process,

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,640
we don't really think that way.

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,000
Right, so I think kind of the old guard was moving out,

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
the new guard was moving in.

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,680
And it never once after that early DIA stuff

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,520
did it ever, ever stop our getting away.

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,440
It was just early on when kind of that old guards there

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,760
and protecting their own, you know, what they believe.

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,800
December 2017 it blows up New York Times story.

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,040
I don't know if you knew that was coming,

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
but I know, you know, the blue has been through the rigor

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
since then.

54
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,000
I also know that Senator Reed, who, you know,

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
let me know it was coming.

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,800
He starts getting phone calls immediately

57
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,080
from former, his former colleagues in the Senate.

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,440
And they're asking, hey, what's the deal?

59
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,000
Does this program real?

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
How do I find out about it?

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,280
Is that when you get sort of pulled back in

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,800
and you start doing briefings or?

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,920
Well, so I was sitting in my office at the other,

64
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,560
non, you know, UFO related job.

65
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,760
And I get an email from my old boss.

66
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,840
There was a link to the New York Times story

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,880
and she said Merry Christmas, because I had no idea

68
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,080
that was coming at all.

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,240
And it was literally a holy crap, you know,

70
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,080
when you're reading that and you have some inside baseball

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,040
knowledge and, but they didn't have any security concerns.

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,400
You know, it was like, yeah, if I had security concerns,

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,280
I would have addressed it with the security concern.

74
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,320
I had the, you know, I can't believe we're saying all this

75
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,360
and New York Times, because of everything

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,240
that was involved, right?

77
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,400
But I didn't know it was coming.

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,040
It took me by surprise.

79
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,280
I had zero intent at that point of working the topic again

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
and they're just one of them out.

81
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
They could revack it.

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,920
It's exactly what happened.

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Exactly what happened.

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,600
So my old boss, the sent me the email,

85
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,400
some time after that sent me a position

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,120
and said I should consider it.

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,680
And I did and I applied and I got that.

88
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,840
That was that promotion.

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,640
I was actually stepping back into office

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,720
and able to tell you this to do a different job.

91
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,720
But at that point, you know, your pilots have been taking

92
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,760
the Congress, the Senate Armed Service Committee

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,400
and all these folks had interest in the topic.

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,040
And my boss realizing, you know, she knew all along.

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,600
Hey, I got one guy that's got some history in this

96
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,920
and the trust to tackle it appropriately

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,560
and keep it professional and do all the things

98
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,680
that need to be done.

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,240
So she reached out and said, hey, I want you to take this over.

100
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,640
And she really wanted a joint program as a word she used

101
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,400
but you know, a joint effort built to tackle this problem

102
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
and get out ahead of it because of the,

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,440
now, it's the districts of the world, right?

104
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,760
The people that we want to take care of.

105
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,040
And I'll only say her name because she's come out herself

106
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,040
and with that, I took it, I had the authority.

107
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,880
We call it Dirlos, directly, liaison authority.

108
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,320
I had directly guys on authority across the entire government.

109
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,480
She empowered me with her, you know, her, her power to do that

110
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
to say just go for it.

111
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,480
And I wouldn't let anything stop me unless they threw me out, right?

112
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,320
So I started going through my own education and saying,

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,720
here's what I need.

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,160
And that came from the years of looking at this

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,880
and I knew I needed things like the FBI and the Coast Guard

116
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,680
and others for their title 18 authorities.

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,760
I needed folks of the right title, 50 authorities,

118
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,280
the folks of the right title, 10 authorities.

119
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,200
And to do this right and to get that level of respect

120
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,440
and get to those true answers,

121
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,720
you've got to have the right people involved, right?

122
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,800
So I went out like building business

123
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,400
and started knocking on doors and now thanks to my new rank,

124
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
I pretty much got doors open, right?

125
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,720
And previously, they would have might,

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,200
might would have opened the doors, but now the,

127
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,200
I assume this guy has to say, at that point,

128
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,080
you know, we had the gimbal and other things

129
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,360
right that people know about, but we had more, obviously.

130
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm going through what we know, we don't know what we think

131
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,840
and everywhere I went because, again,

132
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,160
of that education of how to present the data,

133
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,840
how to present the information, they went, holy crap.

134
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,160
How can we help, right?

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
And I ended up with somebody in each organization,

136
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
it was kind of my belly button and say, hey,

137
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,160
this is your guy, he'll help you.

138
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,960
And I just started building out that business

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120
and that framework and getting the things

140
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
that we needed to be successful.

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,080
I would call it at that point a partnership,

142
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,240
not a task force, because really,

143
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,080
you know, task force is a legal thing

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,440
and in the DOD circles, but we were this,

145
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,760
this partnership with the right people,

146
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,600
across the services, everybody approaching it

147
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,400
from the right perspective, that thing.

148
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,640
No, I started loosely calling it a task force,

149
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,280
but that was very loose, it was really,

150
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,240
and the way I would brief it as partnership,

151
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,640
you know, as I kind of show who's helping out.

152
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,680
And but at that point, I am brief and Congress,

153
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,080
you know, from that day forward, right?

154
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,600
Where I went in and briefed a couple of the committees

155
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,320
on my plan, I had what I called a one-pager.

156
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,720
Again, I'm, you know, from marketing perspective,

157
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,160
everything on one page, and here's what I'm gonna do,

158
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,200
and here's how I'm gonna do it, and they loved it,

159
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,800
and they got behind it, and you saw some language

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,080
coming out of the authorization for that.

161
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,360
I heard it became a hot ticket that, you know,

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,320
whereas before it was not nothing that ever popped up

163
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,840
in Congress and suddenly, hey, let's have a hearing,

164
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,920
show us the video.

165
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,560
Absolutely, and again, it's how you present the data, right?

166
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,720
And there were plenty, there were still a few

167
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,080
of the old guard kind of hanging out

168
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,040
that could prevent me from being successful,

169
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,840
and some of them did not want to hear from me, right?

170
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,240
They don't want to get the briefing,

171
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,680
but every time I finally got the brief,

172
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
they were supportive.

173
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,000
Every congressman, I ever briefed, except one,

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,080
I won't say who, and it gets back to the belief word.

175
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,560
Everybody understood where I was coming from,

176
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,360
and the problem said, and at the end of the day,

177
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,880
the business I built was working, and it was,

178
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,360
what we finally needed, right?

179
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,960
It's sort of reminds you of Michael Corleoni,

180
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
just what I'm out, that I thought I was out,

181
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,800
they pulled me back in, it's a kind of thing.

182
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,480
So, again, he was not a UFO guy, he was doing his job.

183
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,640
And each of the times he was asked to do this,

184
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,720
he was doing his job.

185
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,040
And you know, something else he said,

186
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,840
that really impacted me was, you know,

187
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
he was a really high rank, and I don't want to get into exactly

188
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,720
like how that works, but, you know,

189
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,520
we'd say in a equivalent of, let's just say, really high rank.

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,480
So, a lot of people could have pressured him

191
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,480
because of their rank to try to diminish the work he was doing,

192
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,280
but he resisted that all along the way,

193
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,360
and did the right thing, and I just,

194
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,040
I thought that was a really cool thing to hear from somebody,

195
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,800
and to know it to be true.

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,120
Yeah, the public knows a lot about the role of Lou Elisando,

197
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,160
both in blowing the story wide open,

198
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,120
and trying to get a bigger program,

199
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,440
and in bringing some of the aviators and other witnesses,

200
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,080
escorting them to Congress, he and Chris Melon,

201
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,680
work on pushing that ball down the field.

202
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,120
Jay Stratton is the unsung hero,

203
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,120
who is working in obscurity,

204
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,800
but doing the really important stuff,

205
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,360
and this was, he didn't have a program,

206
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,640
it wasn't called the UAP Task Force.

207
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
It was after that New York Times story,

208
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
and Congress starts asking questions

209
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,200
that he was putting in charge of an inquiry,

210
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,880
you know, to try to pull all the different strings together

211
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,320
to start pulling information together and cases,

212
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,080
and getting a structure of an organization

213
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,840
that became the UAP Task Force later on.

214
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,200
Jay Stratton started the UAP Task Force,

215
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,000
and that was huge for transparency on the subject.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,080
I do wanna say you're like, he's the unsung hero.

217
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,840
I'm gonna say though, Lou gets a lot of grief

218
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,320
that it's not valid grief.

219
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,560
He's really endured a lot of slings and arrows, as you say.

220
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
So it's like, you know, be in a hero,

221
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
and this ain't what it cracked up to be, maybe.

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I mean, he is to me, absolutely a hero to this topic,

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,920
and I think it's important what he's done.

224
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,120
I think Jay coming forward with us on camera.

225
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
I think I hope.
