1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
This is not, they don't know anything about it.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,920
Well, there are some pretty dramatic cases

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,200
that were studied also by OSAP

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,880
that were written up into reports.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,240
All they have to do is ask for it.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,240
Congress seemed to only know a little bits and pieces.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,000
They were unaware, seemingly unaware

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,720
that OSAP ever existed.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,560
When the Navy guys were asked,

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,960
is there anything between Project,

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,920
Blue Book and A-Tip?

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
Nope.

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,040
Well, that's not true.

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,040
I mean, you know, it was a lot of money.

15
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,800
Millions of public dollars were spent on that.

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,280
The stories have been all over the world.

17
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,520
The book has been written of the people

18
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,680
who are involved in the program

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,000
of Comfort and talked about it.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,080
How can they not know?

21
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,880
Yeah, no.

22
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,480
Yeah, ma'am.

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,880
So I guess, you know, kind of where we're at here

24
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,520
is it would be really great to hear from somebody

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,720
who actually worked in these programs.

26
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,440
And I think we're going to get that pretty soon.

27
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,600
Thanks for kind of telling us about the report

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,640
and getting to the point we're at.

29
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,040
I guess where I'm at is I'm just excited

30
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,560
to see kind of how this is all assimilated

31
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,560
into our processes like so that I want the American public

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,440
to know if this is true.

33
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,080
I, you know, I don't have the luxury of disbelief

34
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,720
on certain things, but I want it to be stated

35
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,080
and boldly stated, I don't know,

36
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,360
when that's going to come and what the truth is

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,440
or what the full truth is, but I think we're getting closer.

38
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, the public also needs to understand

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,720
as OSAP came to realize that this is way beyond just UFOs.

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,480
You're never going to solve this mystery

41
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,200
just by studying lights in the sky

42
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,560
or craft that appear on the sensor

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,520
and you can't see with your own eyes.

44
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,120
You have to look at the big picture.

45
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,280
And unfortunately, a lot of that gets really weird.

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,960
So strange, maybe it's almost by design.

47
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,880
That it's so strange that people are reluctant to dig into it.

48
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,800
That's how many in the Pentagon seemingly reacted

49
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,920
to the reports that came in from OSAP,

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,240
from the Big Low Organization, it gets really strange.

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,200
The stuff that skinwalker is really strange.

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,920
It's easy to make fun of.

53
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,600
It's easy to dismiss because it's so strange,

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,040
but it really did happen.

55
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,000
And the reports that have not yet been made public

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,040
lay it out in very specific detail

57
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,360
and we're going to be getting into that more

58
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,400
in the course of the next few months on this program.

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
Absolutely.

60
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,400
And I just want to kind of testify here

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,520
that I think I'm nuts and bolts.

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,920
My family thinks I'm just fucking nuts, but the thing is

63
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,440
that I have a resistance.

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
I have a resistance to the high strangers,

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,720
to the weirdness, to the things that seem

66
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,920
to happen around the UFO phenomenon.

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,760
I am cool with Bob Lazar's description of craft,

68
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,600
as an example.

69
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,880
That's what initially the science of that, how that would work.

70
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,640
I am cool with the nuts and bolts.

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
I get an allergy when it comes to the weirder stuff.

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,880
And you know, that's why even with everything I know

73
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,560
that have seen and been briefed on, I have an allergy to it.

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,240
So I can understand the public kind of trying to be like,

75
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,760
that's too weird to be true.

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,520
We can accept flying saucers.

77
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,800
We can accept UFOs.

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,880
We can accept reverse engineering and governments

79
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,320
hiding this and there being a cover up to some degree.

80
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,160
We can accept that.

81
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,160
But when it gets weirder, I empathize with the resistance to it.

82
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,720
Now, I'm going to try.

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm going to try to look at straight and say,

84
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,840
look at it, just like I would anything else.

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,520
But I think hearing from people directly

86
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,680
who have direct experiences in these programs,

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,520
that's going to be the key to understanding that.

88
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,440
Well, Dr. James LeCatsky has spent 20 years

89
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,800
as a rocket scientist at the DIA.

90
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,240
That's as nuts and bolts as you get, studying rockets,

91
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,040
our rockets, other nation's rockets, potential threats.

92
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,640
Jay Stratton, his friend and colleague, also at the DIA,

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,880
nuts and bolts guy, reverse engineering,

94
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,400
how to figure out technology, figuring out the nature of threats,

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,560
of all sorts, both nuts and bolts people,

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
who came to understand that this mystery

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,240
goes way beyond nuts and bolts.

98
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,680
Jay Stratton, we've heard from him today

99
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,760
in pieces of the conversation that you and I had with him.

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
What we haven't heard is some of his personal experiences

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,880
and that goes way beyond just studying lights in the sky.

102
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,440
And hopefully, sometime in the course of 2023,

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,920
he's going to open up about that.

104
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,840
Yeah, well, look, man, I'm looking forward to it.

105
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,040
As always, I'm willing to learn

106
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,040
and the main thing is, I think that having those direct

107
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,400
conversations are going to help around the corners

108
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
for a lot of people, including myself.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
So anyway, thanks, man, that would be fun.

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Yeah, all right.

111
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,640
Yeah.

112
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,200
Follow him as to the weaponized,
