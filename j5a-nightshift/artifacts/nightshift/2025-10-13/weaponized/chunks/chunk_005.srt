1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
In 2018, I released through Kayleus and Mystery Wire a 13-page report about the Tic-Tac incident.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,800
Tic-Tac occurred in 2004.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,840
Your friend, Commander Dave Fraver, is the aviator for the Navy that had the direct encounter

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,840
with this strange object five years later when Ossap is born.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,000
The first case they start looking at is Tic-Tac.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,400
And the person they came to rely on to write the first report and investigate a report

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,280
on Tic-Tac was Jay Stratton.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,720
I released that report in 2018.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,680
It had no insignion, it wasn't signed, it doesn't say who wrote it.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,640
But we could say now, he's the guy wrote it.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
And it was great work.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,560
He talked to all these aviators and different people who were involved in it.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,800
It is one report that then became a much bigger report that has not been made public,

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
but eventually will be someday.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,320
So that's one bit of work that he did.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,960
A second thing that the public would know about is the durds.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,000
There are 38 of these durds, defense intelligence referenced documents, that's the acronym

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
what it means.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,240
And 38 of those reports were prepared for the Ossap program and as Jay explained to us

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,600
when we met with them, you know, it was meant to be a baseline to establish what our baseline

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,200
is for a science and technology in specific kinds of categories and to project what it might

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,720
be 50 years from now.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,840
You know, I remember when I made some of those, when you and I release some of those reports,

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,280
people were gripping and moaning, all this is sci-fi, it's nonsense, it's garbage science.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,160
Well, it's not, that's not how it was received by the defense industry.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,720
They love those reports because it works a really good work.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:45,160
And they needed a baseline from which they could compare when they had UFO cases to analyze,

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
is this ours?

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Could it be ours?

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,680
Could we duplicate that 50 years from now in the, in many times the answer

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
was no?

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Right.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,040
And Jay actually talked about this in this interview that we did, it's like he was saying,

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,800
look, we were trying to find the disruptive technologies in 50 years from now.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,480
The things that we were seeing, the things that we're going on, we didn't have good

36
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
explanations for.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,640
So we have to theorize and get out there like what could it be, how could it be happening?

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,280
It's so interesting to me the way he also said he was so dismissive in a, in a, in a

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,240
calm, cool, collected way because he really empathizes with people to have less information

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
than him.

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,880
And I get that.

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,560
So certain things that are classified within our department of defense, he can't just

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,360
like go out on Twitter and say, even if he gets on Twitter, you know what I mean?

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,640
But he was very clear that if something was identifiable, if something was ours, if something

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,640
was a traditional object or a known foreign nation, or even a question that could be a

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,760
foreign nation that a known, despite the capabilities, that those would not be included

47
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,720
in his reporting, in his analysis.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,160
And he really specifically said, you know, I get it that people think it's just one piece

49
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,360
of evidence like just a video, but you and I are hyper personally aware that there's other

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,960
corroborative evidence that is not for public consumption.

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,640
Jason said himself that we had more information.

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,360
And so when you say, oh, it's, you know, birds, balloons, optical illusions, reflections,

53
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
pilot error.

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,080
He's like bullshit.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
It's not.

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,520
We would never have included it.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,360
And it's nice to hear him say that because it carries a lot more weight than just, you

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,720
know, it actually supports the pilots and people that know because they were there.

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Exactly.

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,280
I mean, you know, the, the armchair experts, the debunkers on social media just throw anything

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
out.

62
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,200
And see what sticks against the wall.

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
It's birds.

64
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,120
It's, you know, it's exhaust from a jet.

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,760
It's ridiculous is what it is.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,840
And, you know, for that explanation to work, any of those, you have to assume the U.S.

67
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,280
military are idiots, that the pilots are idiots, that people, manning the sensors are idiots,

68
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,160
that the analysis done by intelligence officials afterward, that they're all idiots, that

69
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,960
they don't recognize a bird from, you know, an unknown object traveling at a high rate of

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
speed.

71
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,120
Jay did share with us that there is so much information that cannot be shared with the public

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,240
for national security reasons, that went into their analyses of these key cases, gimbal,

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,520
tick-tack, go fast, and a lot of others that you and I got into.

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,040
So he worked with OSAP with Bigelow and Colum and Lakatski and any developed relationships

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,280
and other parts of the Pentagon and the intelligence community that served him well years

76
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,920
later.

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,200
These seven months after OSAP starts, it ended.

78
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,840
And then Luelizando comes along, picks up the pieces, creates what came to be known

79
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
as a tip, and Jay was directly involved with that.

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,600
Well, I don't also Jay developed, it was so cool hearing him talk about this.

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,240
He developed what he said was like asymmetrical approaches, so he would get people in different

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,560
fields because they had different ways to solve problems and he would get them with their

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,560
specialties like a biologist that would look at the spread of information a little bit differently.

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,760
So I really appreciated the way that he would take an intelligence approach to problems

85
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,880
that haven't been solved in traditional means.

86
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,400
So my point is he actually developed staff and teams and this was a big deal.

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,960
I think that what he did in developing, and for people that don't know, so OSAP, we keep

88
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,360
saying that, it's a barrier to repeat advanced aerospace weapon systems application program.

89
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:51,160
That was the largest, best funded government, DIA UFO program in history that is publicly known.

90
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,960
And then as that transition, it turned into a tip, advanced aerospace threat identification

91
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
program.

92
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,920
So those are the acronyms that we keep talking about, but I think it's important to show

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,400
that there's individuals and intelligence agencies that are taking this seriously and building

94
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,560
infrastructure for better reporting and want to be transparent with the American public,

95
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,560
to the degree that is safe with, you know, with problems, with foreign problems, that's so

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
encouraging.

97
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,840
I love that there are a multitude of agencies now that are developing beyond an interest,

98
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,040
but a process to help bring this information to where it needs to go.

99
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,880
It will make you and me obsolete, maybe it's journalists, but it's great, it's happening.

100
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,680
OSAP, the DIA program lasted 27 months and then, you know, because of it, it got into some

101
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,160
pretty controversial areas and became a hot potato within depending on intelligence community.

102
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,320
Louis Osando steps forward and was able to keep something going of a form of the program.

103
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,440
It's not as big, it's not as high profile, but he kept it going and was upset eventually that

104
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,240
it just didn't get enough attention. It didn't get enough resources to be able to do the work

105
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,760
they really needed. J, who was working with Lou, their good friends, a lot of mutual respect

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,120
between the two of them, moved on to another job. He was aware, as he told us, he was aware that

107
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
Louis Osando was going to leave and the reasons why he was going to leave was upset. He was not

108
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,400
aware that the New York Times story was going to come and then boom and happens one day.

109
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:38,960
So that's a funny thing. So Lou, I mean, really, people just don't get this, but Lou is a champion.

110
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,680
I mean, he took something and he kept it going and he made it strong and, you know, I think

111
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,240
and I think J really appreciates that. You can tell from the conversations.

112
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,400
So we get to the point where J is now out of the UFO topic, that's not his task with his intelligence

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,360
job, so he's doing something else. And the way he said it to us was so cool is on December 17th,

114
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,760
you know, whatever it was, 2017 when the New York Times thing, somebody put a paper bang right on his

115
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,000
desk and says, you know, Merry Christmas or have a birthday one of these said, we'll let him tell that story.

116
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,120
I knew Lou was leaving. So again, at that point in the 2017 day and to early 18th time frame,

117
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,760
I was in a job that UFOs were not on my job, and any former fashion. So I did not do that job.

118
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,240
Very conscious throughout my career sticking to what I'm paid to do, right?

119
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,160
However, again, Lou and I are friends and the folks that kind of took it over when I left,

120
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:47,600
I knew him all. And you know, I got a face to face, it's called a tampered, it's a kind of face

121
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:55,120
time with Lou and his office. And this was about, I think, three or so days before he dropped his letter

122
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
and he's holding his letter. You know, there's something that effect, things like,

123
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,800
you know, here's what I'm doing. And I said, you know, good luck. And then, you know, loan behold,

124
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,280
he's on stage with, with how and, and Steve Justice and the team there, and I'm watching.

125
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,280
And it's still at this point. I had no idea it will be back in, in this topic at all, right?

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm watching as an outsider, just like everybody, but I could actually text Lou if I wanted, right?

127
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,160
So I had some insider, but I'm watching and, and interested.

128
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,320
Are you sympathetic to his stated reasons for leaving it that he was frustrated that I can't get through

129
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
to the Secretary of Defense and Trump, but this and it needs to be a higher priority?

130
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,800
I am. You know, what we needed was, was a recognized program of record as we call it, right?

131
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,480
We needed something that had the, the umph behind it, the power behind it, the authority behind it,

132
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,080
to do a lot of things in order to get the answers that needed to be, the answers we needed. And

133
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
you know, I was building towards that later.
