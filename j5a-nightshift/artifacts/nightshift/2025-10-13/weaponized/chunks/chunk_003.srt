1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Spending tons of money against a threat that they say exists where the government needs

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
to say it exists.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,520
So it's kind of a contractual thing of you're building to the validated threat and that's

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,280
what I did at the Defense Intelligence Agency.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,320
Along with also having a science and technical intelligence hat with the Defense of

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,200
Warning Office to look across the spectrum at technology specifically air and space that

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:30,040
are leading edge things that could be disruptive and challenges in the future.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,600
We're looking 10, 20, and sometimes 50 years out depending on the topic and trying to

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,960
provide the Department of Defense and across the Intel community a better understanding

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,120
of some of those potential disruptive threats so that we could get ahead of the game and

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
counter them.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,040
When you're at DIA, I'm ignorant of this stuff, but you are Navy guy who then goes to work

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
for DIA.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,360
Does that mean you're a Navy guy with DIA or you're always a Navy guy?

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,120
So when I transitioned to the Office of Naval Intelligence, I came to the service.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,920
So I'm a Navy employee with the national and tell community.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,120
So your service centers, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the nasic, national air and

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,520
space and tell center, the missile and space and tell center is a sub component of the

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,200
DIA that's here in Huntsville and then you have the NCIA, which is a Marine Corps intelligence

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,920
activity and then finally the National Ground Intel Center at Charlottesville.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,720
Those are the four of what we call service centers and now you're going to have one for the

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,960
space force, co-located at right-pattest and air force space.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,240
Those are service centers that support the analysis that supports the Navy or supports

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,680
the Marine Corps, supports the Army, but in reality they are all funded by the Director

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,160
of National Intelligence now, the ODI and I, as National Intel funded billets that are able

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
to support.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,040
So people refer to the ODI, the Office of Naval Intelligence is the Navy's Intel Center.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
The reality is it's the National Maritime Intel Center where we are the threat at the

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,480
maritime and when you think of Navy too, you got to remember that Navy is the Navy, but

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,800
the Navy also has an Air Force and the Navy has an Army and the Navy's Army has an Air

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Force, right?

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,040
So it's a big service.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,760
With that, when I have a big footprint and a big concern, but in all of that, the key in

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,040
bringing up that the ODI and I funds the four service centers is very important because

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,760
back to the threat that justifies the building of new systems and such, right?

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,880
The Air Force really wants a program.

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,600
They might go to an Asia and say, we need a threat to drive that program and we are funded

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,000
by the National side of the house, so we can say, well, we don't take orders from the Air

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,160
Force in that regard, we'll take orders from the Navy so we can, you know, this is the

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
assessment, right?

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,160
That's driven out of treecraft and that's the answer.

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,560
It's going to independent, you know?

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
It's a very independent, and a lot of people don't realize that, you know, they look

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,800
at those service Intel centers as kind of parts of the Air Force parts of the Army.

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,760
They are on paper, but in reality, you know, the majority of their budget comes from

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
the National.

47
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,840
So, you have high security clients, you sense it if you stop the sensitive as you get.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,400
The author of my career, so from there, you know, do you want back to ODI to be the head

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
of Air Warfare?

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Really?

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,400
That was the deputy initially, then the fleet it up was, we say, to be the director of Air

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Warfare for ODI.

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,080
And when I first went back, we had everything that touches there in the Navy, so science

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,240
and technical side as well as the operational and tactics side, we call it spear is kind

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,080
of the nickname for the name that that organization uses.

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,720
We've got a history all the way back to Desert Storm.

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,520
If you watch Top Gun originally Charlie, that's briefing the Migs, she was based on a

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
spear analyst.

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,720
So, the group that I led has that kind of pedigree of talking about how capabilities operate.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,440
So, you know, your National Intel Center, it nasic, for example, right, can talk about

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,760
a Russian fighter and you know, just throw an example when you, everybody knows we look

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
in Russia.

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,240
A Russian fighter talk about how fast it flies, how high it can fly based on it in their

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,000
assessments, right?

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,600
What spear does is we get into the head of the pilots, and we try to talk about how they're

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
going to fly that aircraft.

67
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,800
You know, when the analogies they've used for years is hockey players, right, every hockey

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,120
player has an out of skate, some of them are better than the others, but it's really about

69
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
the game, right?

70
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,320
It's about everything else but skating, skating comes second.

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,560
So if you think about that and apply it to a fighter aircraft, it's how they're, how

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
they're deploying that, right?

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,720
And guys, what my background can watch, somebody flying an airplane and go, man, he's

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
probably Russian, right?

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
You know, whoever, right, everybody, that's probably American, so, you know, you really

76
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,960
can recognize some of the techniques and the way they do things.

77
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,760
You know, if mutual friend of ours was trying to describe how high up you went and he

78
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,240
compared you to a two-star animal, that wasn't accurate exactly.

79
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,200
You weren't comfortable with that, but how would I explain to our audience how far up

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
the wrong you went?

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm sure it's, it's right in, and I didn't want to really push any buttons with that.

82
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,640
So from, oh, and I went to the Pentagon and I worked in in two and six, which is the headquarters

83
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,360
level for naval intelligence.

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,320
The director of naval intelligence is, is dual-headed is what we call the in two and

85
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,080
six, was just the, you know, the op-nav office code.

86
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,360
At that point, I was still a 15, and then I went off to be the J2, the director of intelligence

87
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,920
for the joint warfare in health, the center of Dahlgren, and then from there I was promoted

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,040
initially to what we call tier one, defense intelligence senior level, tier one, which

89
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,040
is a, as a senior executive position, and then was, well, then eight months or so, I was

90
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:41,960
bumped up to a tier two, which is where the two-star comes in, you know, it's an equivalency

91
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,600
throughout my career, it's been, you know, are you really equal, right?

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,200
We always throw out GS-15s or kernels or, you know, there's an equivalency, but you don't

93
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:57,240
go bustling around the Pentagon saying, oh, how rank you, or, you know, so, right, yeah, but

94
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,640
you do have the, the gravitas, if that's a good word to use, that's not a good word to use,

95
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,520
the kind of the, the peer level, right?

96
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,480
So, you know, if I'd go into a meeting with a two-star or one-star, you know, kind of

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,240
have a peer level, so I'm not put in, in a corner, you know, and typically in my meetings,

98
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,920
I, you know, I was there representing someone higher than me, as well as, sometimes I'm

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,440
representing myself, but sometimes I'm there representing someone higher than me, so then I

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,360
inherit their authority, I'm sitting at their seat with their name on it, so I'm speaking

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,960
for that person, I wouldn't be interested in that meeting if I couldn't speak for that person,

102
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,640
and a lot of that in the Pentagon is resource sponsoring, so, you know, I said in many

103
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,760
tables where I was representing the resource sponsor, and that gets attention because acquisition

104
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,520
programs at your Navier, your NAVC, your Air Force material command, those are all built on requirements

105
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,600
back to the thread, right? And, and those requirements are paid for by resource sponsors,

106
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,200
so the resource sponsor says, we need a new jammer, and, and from that resource sponsor,

107
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,000
requirements are driven, and then capabilities are built, and they go to whoever can build that

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,080
capability, whether that's Navier or that's Nav, you know, whoever that might be, right? So,

109
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,800
so in those circles, you know, you get to know a lot of people, and that helped me later to really

110
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,640
kind of know who I need to reach out to. Can you describe for me at what point UFOs they were called

111
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,200
then, UFOs now, at what point that kind of got on your radar screen, was there something that you had

112
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,800
at least a casual interest in growing up, or it came a point in your professional career

113
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,520
that it landed on your desk? Yeah, every time I've done anything related to UAP or UFO has been my

114
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,840
job. And, and what I mean by that, I didn't really have a passion growing up, I didn't have

115
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,840
all the books, I didn't watch all the TV shows, I stepped into a job, I had the Defense Intelligence

116
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,880
Agency, where some things came across the desk, again, thinking technologies and other things,

117
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,880
where I needed to really kind of dig in and understand potentials, and those potentials,

118
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,040
you know, I kept an open mind, a skeptic mind, whatever you want to call it, you know, looking for

119
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:10,920
something that can answer this, and all the means that I had to chase that, but there were definitely

120
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:19,960
some times where we really couldn't close the loop. And with that, we realized that something needed

121
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,920
to be done about it. We should maybe just fill in our listeners about Hal J. Stratton ended up

122
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,440
studying UFOs and related mysteries, because he made it clear to us in our conversation with him.

123
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,040
He's not a UFO guy. He's not sitting at home watching UFO videos on YouTube. He'd watch

124
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,240
guitar playing videos on YouTube, but not UFOs. He didn't have a whole bunch of books. He didn't have

125
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,120
an biting interest in it, but he ended up moving from Office of the Naval Intelligence over to

126
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,480
DIA, and it became an acquaintance and colleague of Dr. Jim LaCascie, who was the creator of

127
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,920
eventually became the creator of the OSAP program. What became OSAP, and LaCascie had an interest

128
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,360
in in Skinwalker Ranch, in the book that Callum and I, Callum Keller, heard I wrote. And while

129
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,760
we'll let Jay Stratton explain how that process went. I can remember telling our mutual friend,

130
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,840
Dr. LaCascie, right, that some of this stuff, I don't, and I hate saying the word now,

131
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,320
because I have so much more background, but the word believe, right? The belief isn't there,

132
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,720
necessarily, that I'm seeing what I think, or was being reported, right? So that evolution between

133
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:42,840
2006, and then to 2008, at that time, I had to go to Iraq, just normal deployment, and because we did

134
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,680
to place civilians. A lot of people don't realize that civilians are just on the hope, just like military.

135
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:56,840
In 2006 and 7th time for him, as we were trying to think about this problem said, Jim LaCascie says,
