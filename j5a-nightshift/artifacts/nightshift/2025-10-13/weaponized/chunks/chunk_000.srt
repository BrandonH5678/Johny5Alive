00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Imagine being 12 years old, already having 30 bone fractures, and wondering, why can't I just play like other kids?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
I'm Leanne, and I was diagnosed with brittle bone disease.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, I'm running the Bank of America as Chicago Marathon for Larry Children's.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, every kid can just be a kid.

Secrets, cover ups, and strange phenomena.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
UFOs and ideas that challenge reality itself.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All these mysteries, all this time, we're ever going to get to the bottom of these.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
My name is George Nap, I dig into new stories that others can't or won't.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm Jeremy Corbel, and for some reason, people tell me things they probably shouldn't.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And this is weapon weapons.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're back, we'll tell you mine.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh my gosh, so much, man.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, I guess we should start with a number of weeks ago, the new anticipated UFO report.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Official UFO report came out from the government, and there's been a lot of reactions from, you know,

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
dismissals in opinion articles in the New York Times to other people that got it right.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But this was anticipated.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're supposed to come out on Halloween, right?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Twenty-twenty-two.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Here we are on twenty-twenty-three now.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And finally, it's out.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So they call it the twenty-twenty-two annual report on UAP, unidentified aerial phenomena.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's actually the twenty-twenty-three report since it did not come out in twenty-twenty-two.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And looking at it, you know, the first impression you get is,

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
nobody's going to wrench their backpick in this thing up.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's only a couple of pages.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They got a title page, and then a table of contents page, and a couple of index pages at the back,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and terminology, not much report here.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm reminded of, remember when light beer first came out, the slogan was,

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
tastes great, less filling.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's what comes to mind for this.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, in defense of the depth of the report, it is a report of a classified report.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's a report that they did a classified report.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But there are some really sneaky things that you brought to my attention that we're kind of done in this.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I'd like kind of people to know about this from a new standpoint.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, you know, I think there's a difference between this report and the one that came out in twenty-twenty-one.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The UAP task force report to Congress.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It had a hundred and forty-four cases.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's at a hundred and forty-three.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We're unidentified.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This one has a lot more cases.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They added, it's a five hundred and ten cases.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So there's the goods news is that the reporting system that has been implemented is working.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
They even got reports from the U.S. Air Force that says in here, and the U.S. Navy primarily.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We don't know where these incidents happen.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's almost no detail whatsoever.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We don't know if they were in space, whether they were under sea, whether they're over U.S. air space,

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
or the military encountered them somewhere on the world.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't know what the size or shape or capabilities of these are.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We know that there's indication that at least some of these cases are advanced technology that had capabilities

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that were really intriguing.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But really, no details at all.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think the UFO public was prepared to be underwhelmed.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Maybe not quite this underwhelmed.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I mean, overall, there's some good stuff.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The fact that they reported it at all, that they're getting better at identifying what's truly unidentified

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and anomalous on what isn't, is pretty good.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But we know that this is all domain.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We know that these cases span from space air to sea.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now, that's not something obviously that's put out to the public.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But that's why it's called all domain.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's why it's called Transmedium.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I think people got this title based on their bias, like wrong.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think the titles right in the report.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There's a top of it.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think page five can we read that and want people to hear what they said.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You know, continued reporting and robust analysis are providing better fidelity on UAP events.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But many cases remain unresolved.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's right in the report.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's the headline.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That is the important part.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then people try to cherry pick and say, all this stuff that we know is false.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And they put it through major publications.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You know, the mass media needs to look and read everything to be informed.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It doesn't always happen.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It seems like there was a concerted effort to water it down.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I mean, this is the most exciting topic in the world.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's the biggest question in human existence in the history of civilization.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Are we alone?

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It would change the world of what's we get a confirmation that there's another intelligent somewhere.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
They're out there or living among us here.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's huge.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And they do their best to add this bureaucratic jingo type language that

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
junk it up and to dilute how interesting it really is to to make it as least interesting as possible.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It seemed like in the terms that they use.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And you also think about like, you know, who are they that are doing this?

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you just look at who writes certain types of articles, you get a sense that they're,

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
this is not reporting.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
These are people that are inserting certain types of topographical, you know, premises that they come up with.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They come up with biases they come up with.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So if we just report the news, the line, I just read, that's the news.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's what's important.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So look, I don't know what UFOs are.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But I know that it's unexplained and that there's a mechanical aspect too.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, they made a point of adding in a bunch of cases that I think were taken out of the original report.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They said in the...

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Think of you know.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, it says that they added in a hundred and some cases that had been left out.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So adding these back in increased the total.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But it allowed them to say, oh gosh, heck a lot of these are balloons.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A heck a lot of these are drones.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
A lot of it is trash, which is, you remember the New York Times had this pre-bunking piece,

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
where they predicted that's what this report is going to show.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a bunch of drones, it's a bunch of balloons.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes, drones exist.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We're aware that birds fly in the sky.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's not anything new.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I mean, UFOs 101, you learn that 90 to 95% of all UFO cases are explainable.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If you get enough information, they're explainable.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They are drones, they're balloons, they're planets, they're clouds, things that sort.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That is the starting point for this conversation.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're aware that cases can be explained.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We're also aware that while 90% are explainable,

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
9 out of 10 are not reported at all.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hold on, it just back up.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm fucking record scratch.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They excluded a bunch of cases because they were explainable,

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
so let's now work on the ones that are not.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What you're saying is they brought those cases back into

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
be able to give these statistics.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, it says it.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The ODI preliminary assessment discussed 144 UAP reports

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and had an information cut off date of five March 2021.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Since then, arrows received 247 new UAP reports,

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but an additional 119 UAP reports on events that occurred

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
before March 5th, 2021.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But we're not included in that assessment

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
have been discovered or reported.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So they took them that have been discarded and put them back in

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and allows them to sort of dilute the overall impact of this.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
By saying, oh gosh, these are explainable.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And we know who discarded them.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So they could focus on the true UAP mystery.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And this was a slide of hand.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Is that what you're saying?

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, it's a little deceptive, I think.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You know, by adding those back in that they already know

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
or explainable.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The reason they were kicked out is because they're explainable.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is it fair to say that there's a minimization process

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
that's occurring to the public?

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They're trying to minimize some of the gravity of this

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to the public.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Is that fair to say?

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, they brought back in cases that are explainable.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They dumb down the language.

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Made it as clunky as possible.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And as least interesting as possible.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Trying to make it less dramatic.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Almost as if hey, there's really nothing to see here, folks.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We did our duty.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We got this report.

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We now have processes in place that

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
where it makes it easier to report this stuff.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But we're explaining it.

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't you worry you're pretty little heads kind of thing.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And one of the reasons we know about that process for the

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
first report is because you and I were able to talk to

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the chief scientist for the UAP task force.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's right.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And he's a guy who is well-known to our listeners,

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
to viewers from television.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Dr. Travis Taylor has been on ancient aliens number

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
of times.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He's been on the Secret of Skinwalker Ranch at the past couple of years.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A well-known as a scientist who is interested in the UFO

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and related mysteries.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What most people don't know is that he was serving

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
as the chief scientist for the UAP task force.

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We learned that and we're floored by it on a trip.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We made two Alabama last last fall, a last summer.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I learned about it before, but you reported on it first.

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You told people about that.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And it kind of threw people for a loop because they know

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
from TV, you know from this.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But look, this guy's a serious scientist.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And he's done a lot of work.
