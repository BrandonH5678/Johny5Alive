1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Basically, I made the comments on the effect of,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,040
I'd love to see one with my own eyes.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,840
And one I meant by one is a nuts and bolts craft, right?

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,280
Because in my mind, that's why I'm a technology aerospace guy.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,680
I'm thinking the craft that I can go touch and put my hands on, right?

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,800
Or I'd like to see one of these things in person.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,560
And I'm just getting ready to go.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,120
And Jim was always tracking the ranch.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,720
And he kind of made a joke.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,280
I don't even see it's a joke.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,520
A comment of, hey, there's one place in the world.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,720
We might see one of these things as this place.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,520
And he hands me your book.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,000
And I throw the book in my backpack and literally

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,360
took it to a rack with me.

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,120
So I read that book in the green zone and in my downtime.

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,880
And before I even got back, we're talking

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,680
and things are proceeding along.

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,040
But so I come back.

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,920
And at that time, we were initially,

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,760
the defense warning office in the IA was at the die act we

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,480
called the Defense Intelligence Analysis Center

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,240
at Bowling Air Force Base.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,680
Now, granted, I was flight test back in the day

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
as Pax River and Naval Air Station,

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,840
which is in St. Mary's County, Maryland.

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
So I still live there.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240
And I never sold my house throughout this whole process

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,640
because I liked where I lived.

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,920
But I was making really terrible commutes.

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,480
So I agreed to work at the Defense Intelligence Agency

32
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
and made that commute.

33
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,120
And then the process they transferred us,

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,800
14 miles through the city to another place.

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,560
And I can remember the quote to this day.

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,840
There's also only 14 miles J,

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,800
but it's 14 miles of DC hell, right?

38
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,480
You're going through the commute there.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,880
So anyway, we end up in this place.

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,960
It's called Clarenod.

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,840
And it was really killing me physically.

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,320
You know, just to drive every day and the stress of that.

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,160
I love the job, but the stress of getting there in home.

44
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,560
And in 2008, oh, when I offered me the position

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,840
to come back and be the Deputy Director of Warfare,

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
which was a lot better commute.

47
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,560
And I love the one I, I kind of grew up there

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
and in the Intel community.

49
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,960
So I took that job and left.

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,080
Dr. Ocaschi stayed in touch.

51
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,600
But that contract, it was already in the beginnings.

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,560
And then in 2009, if I remember my time-longing rate,

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,040
he put it on Fed Bizzops to be bid.

54
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,440
And they had two bidders that I remember.

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,640
I won't be in Bob Bigel, Bigel of Airspace

56
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,720
and other being a company that I don't remember the name of,

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,600
but it was a company that did a lot of business

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,720
with DIA and kind of that contract rolled.

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,360
You know, you have your favorite customers

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
in your favorite.

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,160
But there were more than one bid.

62
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,040
I didn't know what funny business that you can see.

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
It was none at all.

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
It was.

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
And I know all of the leadership, right?

66
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,320
I worked there, worked for them.

67
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,600
They're the most straightforward honest people

68
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,360
that you can imagine.

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,120
And they could not, I could never in a million years

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,840
imagine them taking any kind of favoritism

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
in their account.

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,560
I guarantee they went over everything very detail

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,960
and made a decision based on the best response

74
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,680
to the proposal that they had.

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,760
They fire up this program, Bigel of Airspace

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,600
and Springs in Action, they create these 38 papers.

77
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,960
We've heard that described as junk science.

78
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you recall how those papers were received

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,320
when they came out?

80
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,000
So what I remember, so LaCatski, Dr. LaCatski,

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,800
that was driving that and our colleague, Dr. Howe put off,

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,440
kind of led the charge there, supporting Bigel of Airspace.

83
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,200
And the idea of them in my mind was awesome, right?

84
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,720
I'll have this reference document

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,800
that I can always go back to on all these different technologies.

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,280
They did come back being really academic, right?

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Very high level, academic, whereas we're dealing

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,200
with the defense intelligence agency that the predominance

89
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,040
is the liberal arts degree.

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,520
And there were on terrorism, was hot and heavy,

91
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,760
right, we're hiring people who are experts in that culture

92
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,520
and hiring some people just because they

93
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,160
speak Arabic, and all these things, it wasn't.

94
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,920
We weren't hiring the best and brightest engineers

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,200
at the time because it just wasn't the need

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,400
to do the DIA.

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,920
So if you take all of that into context and you realize

98
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,160
your average GIA analyst is going to look at that

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,880
with their polysci or history background and go,

100
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
what is this, right?

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,360
Whereas other folks out AFRL and folks with the educational background

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,360
and look at it and go, oh, this is interesting.

103
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,520
But they may say some of it is junk science

104
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,160
because it is bleeding edge and that's what we wanted.

105
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,600
We wanted to know what they thought

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,240
is the leading expert on a potential technology,

107
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,000
what would be pushing the edge of that envelope

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
because I needed something to point back to

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,080
if I saw something in any kind of reporting

110
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,360
and I could say, look, based on Dr. XYZ,

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,680
that wrote this report, that's significant.

112
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,360
You've seen what else was produced by a set

113
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,120
of that 27 months, I mean, it's a lot of stuff.

114
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,480
But a lot of it is some of it is pretty weird.

115
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,560
I mean, the skinlock, right?

116
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,320
I've heard it said now, people who wanted to integrate

117
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,280
the program that it was nonsense.

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,640
It got off and all this weird paranormal stuff.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,760
I was never what it was supposed to be.

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,080
And it was a waste of money.

121
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
And that's why it was canceled because it got

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,760
into these weird topics that are just too far out.

123
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,880
In general, can you address the work that was done

124
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,720
by all that?

125
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,200
The reports that you've read that haven't made public

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,280
were those worthwhile on it?

127
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,840
So I think, so I'm back at O and I at this point, right?

128
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,200
So my day-to-day interaction with the contract

129
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,680
and with bass was not there.

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
I didn't have that day-to-day.

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,800
However, Dr. LeCatsky and I, again,

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,280
he wants to pick my brain on things that are being seen.

133
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,880
And I'm still in a role where I'm concerned

134
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,600
about threats to aviation and those types of things, right?

135
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,920
So it's good to keep me and the team that I had

136
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,680
and my larger role-to-decks of experts across the Intel community.

137
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,040
So it was good to keep me up to speed.

138
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,840
The heart and soul of O sap was those technology areas

139
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,520
and the heart and soul of those technology areas

140
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,360
of preventing a disruptive technology.

141
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,320
The other stuff that came out of that was collateral.

142
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,720
You know, if you go to the ranch to see

143
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,480
a nuts and bolts craft that you might be able to put your hands on

144
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,520
and you see other things that you can't explain,

145
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,360
no one to this day can explain.

146
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,120
Is it something to do with the technology?

147
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,880
Is it an effect on the body?

148
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,680
Is it something that's driving you to see things

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,120
that aren't really there?

150
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
You know, all those things needed to be studied.

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,880
And again, throughout this whole process, I'm learning.

152
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,120
All of this comes into the forefront later

153
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,480
with the bigger task force and knowing what I needed

154
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,680
and knowing the kinds of expertise that I needed

155
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,960
and that true diversity may not mean,

156
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,840
whether you're from a certain country

157
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
or you're, I think background or anything else.

158
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,680
Or true diversity, maybe just

159
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,600
clearly the way you think based on your own background

160
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,320
that is kind of an asymmetric approach

161
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,920
to the technology area, right?

162
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,920
For example, hiring biologists to look at the terrorist network

163
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,720
and the thread that of radical Islam

164
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,960
and how it spreads like a virus, right?

165
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,360
You take that same mindset to other things

166
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,200
and the various phenomena that we're seeing.

167
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,000
It's important to bring in that kind of diversity

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,640
just as it's just purely the way they think.

169
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,320
And I always like to bring in folks

170
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,960
with that kind of background that didn't have a military background

171
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,120
because now they're not in this box

172
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,000
and this viewpoint that they're always trying to mold things

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
into, they're coming at you with, well,

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,680
have you thought about this, right?

175
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,720
And that is where the true power of those,

176
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,840
and those papers come from too

177
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,880
because then you've got to be something to point back to you

178
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,160
to say, hey, take a look at this, what do you think, right?

179
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,160
To another academic or, and how could you see that applied?

180
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,200
The family that vacations together, stays together.

181
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,960
At least that was the plan.

182
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,720
It accepts now the dester Lee Desklerk is saying,

183
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,800
he can't confirm your connecting rooms.

184
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
Wait, what?

185
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,880
That's right, ma'am, you have rooms 201 and 709.

186
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,480
No, we cannot be five floors away from our kids.

187
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,880
The doors of double locks will be fine.

188
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,320
When you want connecting rooms confirmed before you arrive,

189
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,240
it matters where you stay.

190
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,280
Welcome to Hilton.

191
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,840
I see your connecting rooms are already confirmed.

192
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,320
Hilton, for this day.

193
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,560
Okay, Chad, today you're going to drive the all-electric Toyota BZ.

194
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,160
But my electric vehicle, phobia.

195
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm not ready, Dr. Ross.

196
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,720
I believe in you.

197
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,360
Oh my gosh, we're inside it.

198
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
Try to take deep breaths, okay?

199
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Move the ventilated seats, they're touching me!

200
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
We can do this, Chad.

201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,280
Drive the car, how do you feel, Chad?

202
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
I feel...

203
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Kurt!

204
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
Woohoo!

205
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,080
I'm doing it!

206
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm doing it!

207
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
The all-electric BZ, one drive can change your mind.

208
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
Toyota, let's go places.

209
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,880
So Jay Stratton is not a UFO guy.

210
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,480
He's, I don't know if you say, a career intelligence officer,

211
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
but oh and I, to DIA,

212
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,800
that the UFO thing hits at him and he realizes there's a void

213
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
there. We need to do this, right?

214
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,240
There are potential threats.

215
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,400
We don't know where they're coming from.

216
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,920
So I'm going to create the UAP Task Force

217
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,960
and we're going to look at this in a badass way.

218
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,640
And we're going to be clear with the American public.

219
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
He also made sure to put that in.

220
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,760
We're going to be clear with the American public.

221
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,840
He did that for a while and then he had a break, right?

222
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
From, it wasn't his job.

223
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,520
And during the time he was doing intelligence in another field,

224
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,440
are we up to that point in the story?

225
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,840
So the public, the UFO public, is aware of the programs

226
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,280
that Jay Stratton was involved in.

227
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
We've mentioned the names of those.

228
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,360
What they don't know is there are already familiar with some of his work.

229
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
For example,
