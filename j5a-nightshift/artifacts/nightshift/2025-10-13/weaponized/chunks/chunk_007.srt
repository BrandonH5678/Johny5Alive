1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
P is treated differently because man, he's done great things and now the public is going to

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
learn about them.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,560
Well you remember, end of 2020, Congress says we want to program, in fact we want to report.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,600
You got, here's the legislation.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,600
We want that report.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,760
You got six months to write it.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,200
So January, Jay's organization starts working on it.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,640
The UAP Task Force, we're going to put this report together and it's precisely that moment.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,840
He gets he ain't got it.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
And it looked really suspicious.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,520
I remember, I reported on it exactly the time when you need him most when the most experienced

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,640
guy in the U.S. government on the UFO mystery is taken out of it and given another job.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,080
But he actually was supposed to be doing that job all along.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,680
This was a temporary duty.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,640
So he has taken out the people who he had left there.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,320
They didn't have a full-time position.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,920
They didn't have any full-time positions.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,800
They didn't have a budget here.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,560
Put this report together for Congress and I think they did a remarkable job in six months

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
to get together.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
That's right.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,440
And he had two people that were putting this report together and I do agree it was a phenomenal

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
job.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,440
He even talked about why, in the interviews with us, he even talked about why he started

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,160
in 2004, rather than going back all the way through UFO history, I was like, why did you

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,560
start in 2004?

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,600
And he explains that really well and there's a clip of it.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,880
So you get a lot of, you know, I said on numerous occasions, right?

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Trust is important.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,680
And you know, I think it was Colin Powell that said you can't search trust.

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,560
The minute you're, I mean, we're already 70 years behind the power curve for trust, right?

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,760
Because everybody says the government's lying to us, right?

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,320
And the whole blue book thing and the whole Roswell thing killed, killed trust, right?

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Very good reason why not to even go there, right?

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,800
And then this whole discussion, you know, the task force and everything else, we kind of started

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,480
in 2004, right, is Mr. Bracet and the congressional hearings.

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,120
You got to start somewhere and it might recommendation when I created it, is that that

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,600
2004 start data is important because that was the first case in recent history where I had

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,720
pilot reporting and data, right, back to the data.

40
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,920
But you take all of that trust and then you get this bureaucratic machine that is the

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,560
Department of Defense and the intel community.

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,440
And then, you know, this is an inner agency, a whole government.

43
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,920
So now you're talking about Congress and you're talking about all the other departments,

44
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,200
your DHS is in your transportation, right, with FAA and everybody has like, you've got to

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,000
have a singular message and that's why I wanted the task force to have its own spokesperson

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,800
so that we're briefing as much as we can of what we're dealing with.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,240
But so you get this whole machine and no matter how hard you try, email is not the best

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,520
communication method, right, and hardly anybody picks up the phone these days.

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,640
So what would happen to me is I would see a response from the DUD spokesperson that, and

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
I would say, oh my gosh, why did we say that, right, you come back and you try to clean

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,720
up, but there's no cleaning up at that point.

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,760
So it was all that circular and then you had agendas, right, you still had, I think you're

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,200
probably aware of Luz's previous and, you know, you had that happening.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,040
And that was also manipulating and driving, because again, DUD is very ranked conscious

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,080
ranked structured organization, right.

56
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,240
So if someone's senior is telling you to do something, it's not illegal, they're probably,

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,480
you know, don't want to risk things and go with it.

58
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,440
So I think you had some of that go on.

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,960
Now I'll tell you, even as they had the task force, I didn't, I didn't get into those

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
politics on purpose.

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,080
In fact, I went back to my old days.

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,200
The fence intelligence agency when I was saying, you were nationally funded and I need to

63
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,600
make an assessment that isn't manipulated by politics, which is actually the law now,

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,880
following 9 and 11.

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,920
I stuck to my guns that I, I am here to, you know, working on behalf of the Intel community

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,520
to give American people an answer and numerous occasions.

67
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,800
Anytime someone tried to play the ranked game, I would just stick to my guns.

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,120
Essentially, the idea that he would choose a date where they have a great amount of systems

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,040
data and move forward from there, it makes total sense.

70
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,160
And I think that was a very smart move.

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm sure there is historic data that we can look at now, but I think that was a great

72
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,400
starting point.

73
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,120
So that was very cool when he did that.

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,400
And the two people that he tasked with doing that report, again, did a remarkable job.

75
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,080
There's something else he did that you and I have referenced in various reports without

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,680
attributing it to him in any way, because it couldn't use his name.

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,280
But there was a briefing presentation that was put together.

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,800
And it was an accumulation of all these cases that Jay and his colleagues had been investigating.

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,840
And a lot of them were had included video and photos and things of that sort.

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,600
And he put this together as a briefing presentation for higher ups in the Pentagon, for members

81
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,520
of Congress, for defense contractors and for the intelligence community.

82
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,040
And he made the case, hey, this is real.

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,720
This is a genuine unknown.

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
This is a national security matter.

85
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,840
We need to take a look at it.

86
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,960
I understand it's a very persuasive piece of information, but some of the images that were

87
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,520
in that briefing document.

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,840
It's classified, but some of the images that came from that are not classified.

89
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Right.

90
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,160
I mean, we'll be clear because we've been clear all along the way is as journalists

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,520
obtaining and releasing unclassified information is absolutely fine.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,920
No designation, nothing like that.

93
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,960
Sure, something could be contained within something classified.

94
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,760
I don't know what I know for sure is that it was confirmed by the Pentagon.

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:42,280
That stuff that we ended up releasing, especially regarding the 2019 events on the West

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,400
Coast, which is something we've covered on an episode at length, one of our last episodes.

97
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:56,960
And I think that the key thing here that I think people should know is that you've got

98
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:05,160
this audio, visual presentation that is being shared within multiple intelligence agencies

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:15,760
why the reason why appears to be to destigmatize, to acclimate people to the possibility

100
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,720
of how do you report this and to encourage reporting going right back up the chain of

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,720
command where it should go, which is a smooth and cool process.

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,000
Prom was they didn't respond a lot to people when they were reported up and they realized

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,880
that was an error and that they should give feedback so people know these reports are going

104
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
somewhere.

105
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
We're taking them seriously.

106
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,120
He also needed to find a way to get beyond NDAs, because sometimes you just overclassify

107
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,880
stuff and people have to do an NDA because something was seen or picked up and they have

108
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,520
to go to the process of getting past NDAs, which I don't know he ever got, but I think

109
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,160
that's important moving forward for, you know, for error if it's going to do some great

110
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
work.

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,520
Yeah, a lot of those cases that were part of his briefing presentation ended up as part

112
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,560
of the UAP Task Force Report to Congress.

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,880
They didn't spell it out and any instances, but we know that that is the case and that

114
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,760
the Congress did respond and did take it seriously.

115
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:19,080
Jay Stratton left government in 2021 and entered the private sector.

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,400
He was happy to move to Huntsville, Alabama, to work for radians.

117
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,040
He was happy to bring Travis Taylor along and as we know, you know, we've been able to

118
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,960
share at least a couple of excerpts from this interview that we did.

119
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,400
There's a lot more coming from Jay Stratton, I think, in 2023.

120
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Oh, I know.

121
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Yeah, we know.

122
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,240
I mean, he is making it a point to communicate as clearly as possible with the American

123
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,440
public about his roles, what he did, what he hopes for the future with this, what's

124
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,080
currently going on.

125
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,120
I think it's great that people will be seeing a lot of him that he'll be coming and

126
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,480
talking about his roles and experiences.

127
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,280
I think when you can put a face, you know what I mean to these people that were really

128
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
before the unsung heroes.

129
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,080
I mean, Intel community people are deep inside.

130
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,320
They don't want to be in front of a camera, but now that people come forward a little

131
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,480
bit and give other people the encouragement and the permission, I think that that's

132
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,320
very powerful for witnesses that have been part of UFO exploitation and reverse engineering

133
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,600
programs and legacy programs or current programs to come forward through the new legislation

134
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,640
that has been passed into law, the protects whistleblowers.

135
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,360
And in fact, it's not just a right to come forward.

136
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,240
In fact, it's a duty.

137
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,680
If there have been programs that have been hidden from congressional oversight, proper

138
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,200
congressional oversight, you have a legal duty to come forward.

139
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,560
So I really hope people are encouraged by this in these programs that we do know exist,

140
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,240
that they do come forward and that they share with our Senate Intelligence Committee or

141
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,880
whatever the process is at this point to get this information for, then hopefully out

142
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,160
to American public, this technology is important, man.

143
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,120
A totally great, you know, I want to say this also about J. Stratton, although I've been

144
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,520
allowed to know of him and then to know him, he is not a source.

145
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,080
He did not leak any of these images to us.

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,720
This is a guy who plays by the rules.

147
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,600
It drove me crazy to know a guy like that who could answer these questions and who could

148
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,760
has access to all kinds of materials that I have not seen that you haven't seen, that

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,080
the public hasn't seen, but he played by the rules.

150
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,920
He used a stickler about that.

151
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,560
Now that he's in the private sector and he is a public citizen of private citizen, he has

152
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,360
a lot more flexibility to pursue these subjects.

153
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,520
He's definitely hooked on it now.

154
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,360
If he wasn't before, he is now.

155
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,280
And we're going to hear a lot more from him in 2023, but I just want to make it clear.

156
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,320
He's not a leaker.

157
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,040
He didn't leak any stuff to us.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,760
It's so funny, man.

159
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,720
People are going to try to, I would too try to guess how this way.

160
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Everybody's been wrong.

161
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,960
