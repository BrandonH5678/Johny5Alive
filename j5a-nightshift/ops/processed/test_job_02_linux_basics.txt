# Linux Operating System Basics

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It has become one of the most important and widely-used operating systems in computing.

## Core Characteristics

**Open Source**: Linux is distributed under the GNU General Public License, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

**Modular Design**: The Linux kernel is highly modular, allowing users to customize their system by enabling or disabling various components.

**Multi-User and Multi-Tasking**: Linux was designed from the ground up to support multiple users running multiple programs simultaneously.

**Security**: Linux's permission system and separation of user privileges provide strong security features that have made it popular for servers and critical systems.

## Distributions

Linux comes in many "distributions" (distros) that package the Linux kernel with various software:
- Ubuntu: Popular for desktop users and beginners
- Debian: Known for stability and extensive software repositories
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux: Widely used in enterprise environments
- Arch Linux: Favored by advanced users who want maximum control

## Command Line Interface

The Linux command line (shell) is powerful and efficient:
- File operations: ls, cp, mv, rm
- Text processing: grep, sed, awk
- System monitoring: top, ps, df
- Package management: apt, yum, pacman (varies by distribution)

## Applications

Linux powers:
- Most web servers and cloud infrastructure
- Android mobile devices
- Supercomputers (over 90% run Linux)
- Embedded systems and IoT devices
- Development environments for programmers
