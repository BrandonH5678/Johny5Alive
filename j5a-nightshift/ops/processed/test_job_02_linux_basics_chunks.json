It has become one of the most important and widely-used operating systems in computing.\n\n## Core Characteristics\n\n**Open Source**: Linux is distributed under the GNU General Public License, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.\n\n**Modular Design**: The Linux kernel is highly modular, allowing users to customize their system by enabling or disabling various components.\n\n**Multi-User and Multi-Tasking**: Linux was designed from the ground up to support multiple users running multiple programs simultaneously.\n\n**Security**: Linux's permission system and separation of user privileges provide strong security features that have made it popular for servers and critical systems.\n\n## Distributions\n\nLinux comes in many \"distributions\" (distros) that package the Linux kernel with various software:\n- Ubuntu: Popular for desktop users and beginners\n- Debian: Known for stability and extensive software repositories\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux: Widely used in enterprise environments\n- Arch Linux: Favored by advanced users who want maximum control\n\n## Command Line Interface\n\nThe Linux command line (shell) is powerful and efficient:\n- File operations: ls, cp, mv, rm\n- Text processing: grep, sed, awk\n- System monitoring: top, ps, df\n- Package management: apt, yum, pacman (varies by distribution)\n\n## Applications",
