# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

## Core Concepts

**Training Data**: Machine learning models learn patterns from datasets containing examples of inputs and desired outputs.

**Features**: The measurable properties or characteristics of the data that the model uses to make predictions or decisions.

**Model**: A mathematical representation of patterns learned from training data, used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Parameters**: Internal variables that the model adjusts during training to minimize prediction errors.

## Types of Machine Learning

**Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data where the correct answer is provided. Common tasks include classification (categorizing data) and regression (predicting continuous values).

**Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data without predefined categories. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical applications.

**Reinforcement Learning**: An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

## The Training Process

**Data Preparation**: Clean and organize data, handle missing values, and split into training and testing sets.

**Feature Engineering**: Select and transform relevant features that help the model learn effectively.

**Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate algorithm (neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, etc.) based on the problem.

**Training**: Feed training data through the model, adjusting parameters to minimize errors.

**Evaluation**: Test the model on unseen data to measure its generalization ability.

**Iteration**: Refine the model based on performance metrics and domain knowledge.

## Common Algorithms

- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values based on linear relationships
- Decision Trees: Makes decisions using a tree-like model of choices
