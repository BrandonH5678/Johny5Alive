      "text": "# J5A Nightshift System Overview\n\nJ5A Nightshift is an autonomous overnight queue/batch management system designed for local LLM operations.\n\n## Key Features\n\n**Phase 1: Local-Only Operations**\n- Runs on 2012 Mac Mini with 16GB RAM\n- Uses Ollama with qwen2.5:7b-instruct model (4.7GB)\n- Safe memory limit: 12GB (leaves 4GB for system)\n- Thermal safety monitoring at 80°C threshold\n- Evidence-based summarization with ≥3 citation requirement\n\n**Processing Pipeline**\nThe system uses a multi-stage pipeline:\n1. Sherlock Ingest: Normalizes content from multiple formats (TXT, MD, PDF, HTML, JSON, URLs) to UTF-8 text\n2. Sherlock Chunk: Splits text into scored excerpts with relevance ranking\n3. LLM Summarization: Generates citations-backed summaries using local model\n4. Validation Gates: Enforces quality requirements (ruff, mypy, pytest for code; citation checking for summaries)\n\n**Job Classification**\nJobs are classified as either \"standard\" or \"demanding\":\n- Standard jobs run immediately with local 7B model (summaries <3000 words, simple code <40 lines)\n- Demanding jobs are parked for Phase 2 API escalation (complex research, large documents, advanced code)\n\n**Quality Gates**\nAll outputs must pass validation:\n- Code validation requires 100% pass on ruff linting, mypy type checking, and pytest tests\n- Summary validation requires ≥3 distinct excerpt citations with verbatim quotes\n- Insufficient evidence outputs are valid when marked explicitly",
