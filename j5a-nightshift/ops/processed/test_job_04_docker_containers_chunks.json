Released in 2013, it has revolutionized software deployment and DevOps practices.\n\n## Container Technology\n\n**Containers vs Virtual Machines**: Containers package application code with its dependencies but share the host OS kernel, making them much lighter than virtual machines which include entire operating systems.\n\n**Images**: Docker images are read-only templates that contain the application, its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files needed to run.\n\n**Layers**: Images are built in layers, with each instruction in a Dockerfile creating a new layer. This layered approach enables efficient storage and transfer.\n\n**Isolation**: Containers provide process and filesystem isolation, allowing applications to run independently without interfering with each other.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n**Consistency**: \"It works on my machine\" problems are eliminated because containers ensure the application runs the same way across all environments.\n\n**Portability**: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, from developer laptops to production servers in the cloud.\n\n**Efficiency**: Containers start in seconds and use minimal resources compared to traditional virtual machines.\n\n**Scalability**: Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes make it easy to scale applications up or down based on demand.\n\n## Docker Components",
