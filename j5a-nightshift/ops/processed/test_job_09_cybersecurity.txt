# Cybersecurity Essentials

Cybersecurity protects computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage.

## Core Principles

**Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals through encryption, access controls, and authentication.

**Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data by preventing unauthorized modifications through checksums, digital signatures, and version control.

**Availability**: Ensuring systems and data remain accessible to authorized users through redundancy, backups, and disaster recovery planning.

## Common Threats

**Malware**: Malicious software including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware designed to damage systems or steal data.

**Phishing**: Social engineering attacks using deceptive emails or websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

**Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overwhelming systems with traffic to make them unavailable to legitimate users.

**Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Intercepting communications between two parties to eavesdrop or manipulate data.

**SQL Injection**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to execute malicious database queries.

## Defense Strategies

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requiring multiple forms of verification beyond just passwords significantly improves account security.

**Encryption**: Converting data into unreadable format using algorithms, protecting information both in transit and at rest.

**Firewalls**: Network security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and alert administrators to potential threats.

**Regular Updates**: Applying security patches promptly closes known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.

## Security Best Practices

- Strong, unique passwords for each account
- Regular backups of critical data
- Principle of least privilege (minimal necessary access)
- Security awareness training for employees
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Incident response planning
- Network segmentation
- Monitoring and logging

## Emerging Challenges

- AI-powered attacks and deepfakes
- IoT device security vulnerabilities
- Cloud security and shared responsibility
- Supply chain attacks
- Quantum computing threats to encryption
