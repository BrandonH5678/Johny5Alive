# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, enabling organizations to access technology resources without maintaining physical infrastructure.

## Service Models

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking. Users manage operating systems and applications while the provider handles hardware.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a development and deployment environment including runtime, database, and web servers. Developers focus on code while the platform manages infrastructure.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers complete applications over the internet. Users access software through web browsers without installation or maintenance.

## Deployment Models

**Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet and shared across organizations. Examples include AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

**Private Cloud**: Infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, offering greater control and security but requiring more management.

**Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them for flexibility and optimization.

## Major Cloud Providers

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: The largest and most mature cloud provider with comprehensive services including EC2, S3, Lambda, and hundreds more.

**Microsoft Azure**: Strong integration with Microsoft products and extensive enterprise services.

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Known for data analytics, machine learning, and Kubernetes orchestration.

## Key Benefits

**Scalability**: Resources can scale up or down based on demand, from handling traffic spikes to accommodating business growth.

**Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing eliminates large upfront capital expenditures and reduces operational costs.

**Global Reach**: Deploy applications across multiple geographic regions to serve users worldwide with low latency.

**Disaster Recovery**: Built-in redundancy and backup services protect against data loss and ensure business continuity.

## Cloud-Native Technologies

- Containers (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Serverless computing (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- Microservices architecture
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
