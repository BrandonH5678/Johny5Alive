Users manage operating systems and applications while the provider handles hardware.\n\n**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a development and deployment environment including runtime, database, and web servers. Developers focus on code while the platform manages infrastructure.\n\n**Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers complete applications over the internet. Users access software through web browsers without installation or maintenance.\n\n## Deployment Models\n\n**Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet and shared across organizations. Examples include AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.\n\n**Private Cloud**: Infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, offering greater control and security but requiring more management.\n\n**Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them for flexibility and optimization.\n\n## Major Cloud Providers\n\n**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: The largest and most mature cloud provider with comprehensive services including EC2, S3, Lambda, and hundreds more.",
