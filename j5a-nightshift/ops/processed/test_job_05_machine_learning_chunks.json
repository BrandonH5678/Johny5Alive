Common tasks include classification (categorizing data) and regression (predicting continuous values).\n\n**Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data without predefined categories. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical applications.\n\n**Reinforcement Learning**: An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.\n\n## The Training Process\n\n**Data Preparation**: Clean and organize data, handle missing values, and split into training and testing sets.",
