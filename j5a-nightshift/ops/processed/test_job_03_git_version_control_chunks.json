It has since become the dominant version control system in software development.\n\n## Fundamental Concepts\n\n**Distributed Architecture**: Unlike centralized version control systems, every Git repository is a complete copy with full history, allowing developers to work independently and merge changes later.\n\n**Commits**: Git stores project history as a series of snapshots (commits) rather than file-based changes, making operations fast and branching lightweight.\n\n**Branches**: Git makes creating and merging branches trivially easy, enabling developers to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.\n\n**Staging Area**: The staging area (index) allows developers to carefully construct commits by selecting which changes to include.\n\n## Essential Commands\n\nBasic workflow commands:\n- git clone: Copy a repository\n- git add: Stage changes for commit\n- git commit: Save staged changes to history\n- git push: Upload local commits to remote repository\n- git pull: Download and merge remote changes\n\nBranching and merging:\n- git branch: List, create, or delete branches\n- git checkout: Switch between branches\n- git merge: Combine branch histories\n\n## Collaboration Features\n\n**Remote Repositories**: Services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket host Git repositories and add features like pull requests, issue tracking, and contin",
