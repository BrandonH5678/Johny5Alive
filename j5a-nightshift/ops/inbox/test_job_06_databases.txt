# Database Management Systems

Databases are organized collections of structured information or data, typically stored electronically and accessed through Database Management Systems (DBMS).

## Relational Databases

**SQL Databases**: Use Structured Query Language (SQL) to define and manipulate data organized in tables with rows and columns.

**ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability ensure reliable transaction processing even in the event of errors or system failures.

**Schema**: Relational databases require a predefined structure (schema) that defines tables, columns, data types, and relationships.

**Normalization**: The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables.

Popular relational databases:
- PostgreSQL: Advanced open-source with extensive features
- MySQL: Widely used, particularly for web applications
- Oracle: Enterprise-grade with comprehensive capabilities
- Microsoft SQL Server: Integrated with Microsoft ecosystem

## NoSQL Databases

**Schema-less Design**: NoSQL databases typically don't require fixed schemas, allowing for more flexible data models.

**Horizontal Scalability**: Designed to scale out across multiple servers rather than scaling up on a single machine.

**Types of NoSQL Databases**:
- Document stores (MongoDB): Store data as JSON-like documents
- Key-value stores (Redis): Simple key-value pairs for fast lookups
- Column-family stores (Cassandra): Organize data by columns rather than rows
- Graph databases (Neo4j): Optimized for relationship-heavy data

## Database Design Principles

**Data Modeling**: Carefully design the structure to reflect real-world entities and their relationships.

**Indexing**: Create indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval at the cost of slower writes.

**Query Optimization**: Write efficient queries and use EXPLAIN plans to understand and improve performance.

**Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups and tested recovery procedures protect against data loss.

## Modern Database Trends

- Cloud databases (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- NewSQL systems combining SQL benefits with NoSQL scalability
- Time-series databases for IoT and monitoring data
- Vector databases for AI and similarity search
- Multi-model databases supporting multiple data paradigms
