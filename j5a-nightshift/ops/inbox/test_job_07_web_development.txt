# Modern Web Development

Web development has evolved dramatically from simple static HTML pages to complex, interactive applications that power modern businesses and services.

## Frontend Development

**HTML5**: The latest version of HTML provides semantic elements, multimedia support, and APIs for advanced web functionality.

**CSS3**: Modern CSS includes flexbox and grid layouts, animations, transitions, and responsive design features for creating beautiful, adaptive interfaces.

**JavaScript**: The dominant programming language for web browsers, with ES6+ bringing modern features like arrow functions, promises, async/await, and modules.

**Frameworks and Libraries**:
- React: Component-based library for building user interfaces
- Vue.js: Progressive framework with gentle learning curve
- Angular: Full-featured framework with TypeScript
- Svelte: Compiler-based approach with minimal runtime overhead

## Backend Development

**Server-Side Languages**:
- Node.js: JavaScript on the server using V8 engine
- Python: Django and Flask frameworks for rapid development
- Ruby: Rails framework emphasizing convention over configuration
- PHP: Still powering many websites including WordPress
- Java: Spring framework for enterprise applications

**RESTful APIs**: Architectural style using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for client-server communication with stateless operations.

**GraphQL**: Query language allowing clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching problems.

## Full-Stack Development

**MEAN/MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express, Angular/React, Node.js - popular JavaScript-based full-stack combinations.

**JAMstack**: JavaScript, APIs, and Markup - modern architecture for fast, secure websites with decoupled frontend and backend.

## Web Performance

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization and modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Content Delivery Networks (CDN) for global distribution
- Caching strategies (browser, service worker, server-side)
- Minification and compression

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS encryption for all connections
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens
- Secure authentication and authorization
