# Agile Software Development

Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery of working software.

## Agile Manifesto Values

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools: Emphasizing team communication and collaboration rather than rigid adherence to procedures.

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation: Prioritizing functional code that delivers value while maintaining necessary documentation.

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation: Engaging customers throughout development to ensure the product meets their evolving needs.

**Responding to change** over following a plan: Embracing changing requirements even late in development to maintain competitive advantage.

## Scrum Framework

**Roles**:
- Product Owner: Defines features and prioritizes work based on business value
- Scrum Master: Facilitates the process and removes obstacles
- Development Team: Self-organizing group that builds the product

**Events**:
- Sprint: Time-boxed iteration (typically 2-4 weeks) producing potentially shippable product increment
- Sprint Planning: Team commits to work for upcoming sprint
- Daily Standup: Brief daily synchronization meeting
- Sprint Review: Demonstration of completed work to stakeholders
- Sprint Retrospective: Team reflects on process improvements

**Artifacts**:
- Product Backlog: Prioritized list of features and requirements
- Sprint Backlog: Work committed to for current sprint
- Increment: Potentially releasable product version

## Kanban Methodology

**Visual Workflow**: Cards representing work items move across columns showing their status (To Do, In Progress, Done).

**Work in Progress (WIP) Limits**: Constraining concurrent work prevents overload and identifies bottlenecks.

**Continuous Flow**: Unlike Scrum's time-boxed sprints, Kanban allows continuous delivery of completed items.

**Pull System**: Team members pull new work only when capacity exists, maintaining sustainable pace.

## Extreme Programming (XP)

Core practices:
- Pair programming: Two developers working together at one workstation
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before implementation code
- Continuous Integration: Frequently merging code changes into shared repository
- Refactoring: Improving code structure without changing behavior
- Simple design: Implementing only what's needed today

## Benefits of Agile

- Faster time to market with incremental releases
- Improved product quality through continuous testing and feedback
- Greater flexibility to adapt to changing requirements
- Enhanced customer satisfaction through frequent delivery and involvement
- Better risk management through early problem detection
- Increased team morale and productivity
