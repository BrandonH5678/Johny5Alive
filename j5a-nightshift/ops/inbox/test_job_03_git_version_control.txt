# Git Version Control System

Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for managing the Linux kernel source code. It has since become the dominant version control system in software development.

## Fundamental Concepts

**Distributed Architecture**: Unlike centralized version control systems, every Git repository is a complete copy with full history, allowing developers to work independently and merge changes later.

**Commits**: Git stores project history as a series of snapshots (commits) rather than file-based changes, making operations fast and branching lightweight.

**Branches**: Git makes creating and merging branches trivially easy, enabling developers to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.

**Staging Area**: The staging area (index) allows developers to carefully construct commits by selecting which changes to include.

## Essential Commands

Basic workflow commands:
- git clone: Copy a repository
- git add: Stage changes for commit
- git commit: Save staged changes to history
- git push: Upload local commits to remote repository
- git pull: Download and merge remote changes

Branching and merging:
- git branch: List, create, or delete branches
- git checkout: Switch between branches
- git merge: Combine branch histories

## Collaboration Features

**Remote Repositories**: Services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket host Git repositories and add features like pull requests, issue tracking, and continuous integration.

**Pull Requests**: A collaborative workflow where developers propose changes, discuss them, and get approval before merging into the main codebase.

**Conflict Resolution**: Git helps developers identify and resolve conflicts when multiple people modify the same code.

## Best Practices

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit related changes together
- Create feature branches for new work
- Keep commits small and focused
- Pull frequently to stay up-to-date with team changes
