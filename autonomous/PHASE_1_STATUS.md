# Phase 1: Foundation for Autonomy - Status Report

**Date:** 2025-11-29
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (100%)

## Summary

Phase 1 establishes the core infrastructure for J5A autonomous operations. All components are complete and verified.

---

## Phase 1.1: Backup Infrastructure Hardening ✅ COMPLETE

### Accomplishments
- **Pre-autonomous snapshot system** implemented in `agents/jeeves/snapshot.py`
  - `create_pre_autonomous_snapshot()` - Creates tagged git snapshot with remote verification
  - `_push_with_verification()` - Ensures backup reaches GitHub
  - `rollback_to_tag()` - Enables quick recovery
  - `list_pre_autonomous_snapshots()` - Lists available restore points

- **Rollback CLI** created at `agents/jeeves/rollback.py`
  - Commands: `list`, `rollback`, `latest`

- **GitHub remotes verified** for:
  - Johny5Alive
  - Squirt
  - Sherlock

### Tag Convention

## Phase 1.2: Claude Code Autonomy Configuration ✅ COMPLETE

### Accomplishments
- **Project settings** created at `.claude/settings.json`
  - Permission pre-authorization for approved operations
  - Scope declaration requirements
  - Allowed directories configuration

- **Task Schema** defined at `autonomous/task_schema.json`
  - JSON Schema for autonomous task specifications
  - Scope, success criteria, rollback triggers

- **Task Executor** implemented at `autonomous/task_executor.py`
  - Permission-at-assignment model
  - Automatic snapshot before execution
  - Validation and rollback capabilities

### Key Files
```
.claude/settings.json          # Claude Code permissions
autonomous/task_schema.json    # Task specification format
autonomous/task_executor.py    # Execution engine
autonomous/example_task.json   # Sample task
```

---

## Phase 1.3: Validation Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

### Accomplishments
- **Phoenix/Kaizen/Night Shift modules** reviewed and operational
- **Qwen validation format** created at `autonomous/qwen_validation_format.json`
  - Task types: classification, format_validation, log_analysis, etc.
  - Structured output formats

- **Qwen2.5-7B** downloaded via Ollama on j5a-server
  - 4.7GB model ready for validation tasks
  - Available via `ollama run qwen2.5:7b`

- **Whisper Medium model** downloaded on j5a-server
  - GPU-accelerated transcription ready
  - Available in `~/whisper-env/`

### Pending (Phase 2+)
- **Qwen benchmarking** - Scheduled for Phase 2 integration testing
  - Validation task accuracy testing
  - Response time benchmarks

---

## Phase 1.4: Cloudflare Tunnel Setup ✅ COMPLETE

### Accomplishments
- **cloudflared v2025.11.1** installed on j5a-server
- **Quick Tunnel** infrastructure verified
  - HTTP/2 protocol configured
  - Connected to PDX datacenter
  - Ollama API exposed

### Current Test URL
```

```

### Documentation
Full setup guide at `autonomous/cloudflare_tunnel_setup.md`

### Known Issue
Quick Tunnels have bot protection that blocks curl/automated requests with 403. Browser access works. Production will use Named Tunnel with Cloudflare account.

## Completion Summary

All Phase 1 tasks are complete:
- ✅ Backup infrastructure with pre-autonomous snapshots
- ✅ Claude Code permissions configuration
- ✅ Task schema and executor framework
- ✅ Qwen2.5-7B and Whisper medium models downloaded
- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel infrastructure verified
